 On Android Enthusiasts SE, there are half dozen questions relating to whether a mobile device while charging should be used for gaming, downloading etc. Answering a  recent question  on this, I cited a technical resource  from "Battery University", to say that downloading when charging is not advisable. Subsequently, carried out  tests  which support a larger perspective that even switching on the device is not recommended (link points to Electrical SE where I posted results to get more inputs-it has extracts from the technical resource as background)    These tests and conclusion stated , would be the the "what I researched or did " part of the question and the question itself would be on lines of "based on this tests and the technical resource , it is not advisable to charge with device on, are there reasons or grounds to the contrary" (haven't got down to the exact words , but that is the essence)    My concern is that the central point being "battery tests", some may view this as "Android Independent" and mark for closure.     Whereas, I feel     a) It has relevance to all Android users, which every device owner has to do (charging) and quite a few if not most switch the device on or use it while charging.    b) The tests do not require any hardware or specialised knowledge and are done using an app from Play Store.    c) this proposed question is not limited to which activity can be done or not as earlier questions addressed, but cover all activities including just switching the cell on.    I have put in a lot of effort in this and wouldn't like to see the question marked as Android Independent or Off Topic. I haven't found a similar question on meta, dealing with this kind of border line case, so request advice how to go about it    Thanks      EDIT     I have received a mail from Battery University , in response to a request from me, and similarly from SE Electrical both pointing to my tests being incorrect or interpretations incorrect. To that extent, there is no need need to post now    However, I am not closing the question on my own, since the  concern raised merits decision on such cases being reviewed   Advice on avoiding a question being marked "Android Independent"/off topic" discussion

 A new user posted a  question  that is really an answer.  As @AndrewT observed, it seems to be an answer to  this  protected question.

 It's 2016 now, and we've  made some changes to the sidebar size . As such, we can now restart the Community Promotion Ads for 2016!    Keep in mind, we have updated some of the guidelines compared to previously - the changes are marked in bold in the Image Requirements section.    What are Community Promotion Ads?    Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.    Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?    This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:      interesting Android apps   the site's twitter account   cool events or conferences   anything else your community would genuinely be interested in      The goal is for future visitors to find out about  the stuff your community deems important . This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are  relevant to your own community's interests , both for those already in the community and those yet to join.     Why do we reset the ads every year?    Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.    The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.    How does it work?    The answers you post to this question  must  conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored.        All answers should be in the exact form of:     [![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]     [1]: http://image-url    [2]: http://clickthrough-url       Please  do not add anything else to the body of the post . If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.     The question must always be tagged with the magic  community-ads  tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.       Image requirements      The image that you create must be  300 x 250 pixels , or double that if high DPI.   Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)   Must be GIF or PNG   No animated GIFs   Absolute limit on file size of  150 KB     If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.       Score Threshold    There is a  minimum score threshold  an answer must meet (currently  6 ) before it will be shown on the main site.    You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats  here .   Community Promotion Ads - 2016 discussion  community-ads

 The question  here  (deleted;  record ) was migrated from Stack Overflow to our site. It was moved by a moderator of Stack Overflow and per the [currently deleted] comments there, the migration was proposed by a user using a flag. During my conversation with that moderator (say M1), I concluded that their site policy on migration  doesn't respect the on-topic guidelines of destination site .  From M1 :     ( Record )         Our current policy is to migrate content that has been requested to be migrated and let the destination site reject if it is not.       (The question  here  doesn't have answers useful to my question. The answer  here  has very good recommendation about migration but the view count of the page indicates that it may not be a policy accepted by many. Beyond them, I failed to find community consensus reflected in the noted quote. I can't confirm whether this is M1's personal policy or a policy privately or publicy created by all elected Stack Overflow's moderators or created through community's consensus.)     Let me simplify the quote. It is not their business to find whether the post would be on-topic on the destination site. If the post is not on-topic to them and a migration has been requested, they would throw the post on destination site and latter has to deal with whatsoever comes to them,  including but not limited to crap i.e. purely worthless stuff.     Any  moderator of a site is a representative of that site to other network sites and the outside world. By the very nature of the authority they handle, a moderator would and should know all that is needed to run the site (that includes  sound understanding of migration ) and is alone in a position to define what is good for the site and what's not, to a certain extent of course. So if I (a user from the network), hear from a site's moderator, anything about a policy of their site then I've no reason to disregard their word. Correct?    Let's come back to the issue now. In the midst of 2014, a trusted user of our site  requested users from Stack Overflow  to not migrate posts which are already off-topic to us. It was  answered  by a Stack Overflow's moderator with the following reason with regard to the  localized issue of that question:        Not entirely sure why, or why a moderator accepted that, but that's what started this. We usually decline these flags, so this is probably just an honest mistake.      Given that quote, the policy M1 uses may have been framed up after Jun 16, 2014. Please comment the link if you know where the policy is.    From FAQ for Stack Exchange sites:  What is migration and how does it work?         Things to consider when migrating questions              Don't migrate crap!  Ever. If the question is likely to be closed on the destination site anyway, don't bother migrating it. Just close it normally and advise the OP of the other site in the comments. If they decide to improve the question, then they can go post it over there, or they can edit their question and have it migrated later.        Avoid migrating answered questions.  The point of migration is to send the question to a place where it is on-topic and  can  get answered. If the OP already has an answer, then we've already defeated the purpose of migration and the destination site won't have anything to do with the question. Avoid migrating these questions unless they are of extremely good quality and risk deletion on their current site.        Don't migrate for the sake of migration.  We only migrate questions because they are  off-topic on the original site . It is perfectly possible for a question to be on-topic on multiple sites, but that is not a reason to migrate it elsewhere. As a general rule, if someone asks a question  here , and it's on-topic  here , it should stay  here .        Be familiar with the destination site.  If you have never even visited the destination site before, read through the FAQ thoroughly and  make sure  the question actually belongs there. Don't look at the name of a site and automatically assume the question can be asked there. Each site has its own rules, and rules vary greatly across sites.        If you're not sure, don't migrate it.  Let someone else who  is  sure do that, or ask for opinions from the community in a relevant chat room.           Use the migrated question with the quoted FAQ and the following is what you get:       Don't migrate crap! : It was  off-topic and completely of no use to an end-user , hence  crap to us .    Avoid migrating answered questions. : It was already answered on source site. Furthermore, per the first point, the question was not in a position to get answers on our site, let alone helpful ones.     Don't migrate for the sake of migration. : It  was flagged for migration by user(s) and later closed as off-topic by M1 when it was and still is  on-topic to them  ( record ).     Thankfully, our site's moderator showed concern for the author. He appropriately handled the question on our site and later voted to reopen it on Stack Overflow.      Be familiar with the destination site. : Given the actions, I don't think anyone involved in migration  of that question alone , from Stack Overflow to our site, appears to have correct understanding or awareness on what is not to be posted on our site.     What's more painful to know is that that they're actually advising us on   how to handle their garbage . For their information:  We already know how do deal with garbage! Why tell us what we already know?      From M1  ( record ):        [Flag] or vote to close the post as off topic. Once it's closed, it'll reject the migration. That's how the workflow is handled.         If you're not sure, don't migrate it. : Do I now even have to explain this one?          Per the system, I'm neither an experienced user, nor a trusted user or a moderator, so I cannot hope to raise my issue (follow M1's  suggestion , that is) on Meta Stack Overflow since the issue I perceive is a community's issue not my personal one.     Thus, regardless of your reputation points, if you find my issue substantive, the defense put forward strong and appropriate without  ad hominem  attack against anyone involved, then by all means:      please remind Stack Overflow that we're a small site with  much smaller number  (still relevant) of active close voters and that we already have  huge and unavoidable issue  with regard to development/programming questions posted here almost every single day    that, given the first point, we're not in a good position to handle, but regardless  neither do we intend to handle  extra garbage    that  they should dispose their garbage in their own territory  and because  their policy forces us to handle their own garbage  which is a burden on us and completely unjustifiable, that  we kindly request   an exception to our site in their migration policy - the same policy briefly hinted by M1.        Caution:  before you post on Meta Stack Overflow, please make yourself  aware of this attitude  which is nothing but a more shortened version of the policy I heard from M1:        Can't you just reject the migration?         Just so you know, after the conversation (read: disappointing) with M1, I've started wondering  whether I should change my stance here:  Should development questions be put on hold or migrated to SO?    Can we remind our beloved Stack Overflow not to throw garbage on us? discussion  migration 
 How does the questions limited to the scope of a nightly build of a ROM are helpful to site in long-run?    There are questions we receive that are more or less specific to a nightly build of a ROM. (In case one has never heard the term nightly build outside the scope of Android, I recommend reading wiki of  Daily build .) By  specific , I meant examples like the following ones:       CM13 on Nexus 9: Any app that internally opens a webpage or otherwise uses System WebView crashes  ( record )    https://android.stackexchange.com/q/134981/96277  ( record )    https://android.stackexchange.com/q/135350/96277  ( record )    Google Play app won&#39;t open on Cyanogenmod  ( record )    CM 12.1 Nightly Mako Home Button Not Showing  ( record )    Phone Screen Blackouts and respond only to Power Key Long Press  ( record )    CM 12.1 Nexus 5 stuck on bootloop and recovery load-up  ( record )    https://android.stackexchange.com/q/110751/96277  ( record )    https://android.stackexchange.com/q/112894/96277  ( record )    Installed CM12 on Sprint Galaxy S4, GAPPS crashing upon start  ( record )   and the list  goes on ..      If I've to give a brief of those examples, I would say:       individual or all apps crashes or gives ANR messages intermittently or repeatedly   any or all of mobile data, Wi-Fi and bluetooth does not work   encryption does not work correctly   screen blackouts during usage, including but not limited to calls   navigational button stops working   the famous boot-loop or "optimizing apps" at startup followed by a reboot and repetition of same cycle   texts not sent or received      A nightly is:      a ROM in progress, updates often and  users are supposed to use the latest version ;   supposed to be  not used as a daily driver  (a fact folks ignore), hence, ideally not meant for any user but for a tester who takes risk of losing their data;    expected to have bugs  which may or may not be severe, but in any case it is expected that users report bugs whenever encountered so that the latter gets fixed ASAP before a stable build for  all end-users is released.       While nothing stop the issues mentioned in my example cases to occur on stock ROMs or stable builds of custom ROMs, the likelihood of occurrence of them is greater on nightly builds and are often solved in a next build or some other build in near future once reported to ROM's developers. As such, while we may not be losing anything by keeping such questions, I ask again:        What long-term benefit does the site have from those questions?     Is there a problem you also see or have I exaggerated the issue?     As the title asks, what do you recommend for dealing with such questions, other than commenting?       Do note that nightly builds are updated at a faster pace. Possibility of a solution for a bug in a next release is also high if developer is aware of the issue. Once the next build fixes the issue,  the question loses almost all of its usefulness.      This reminds me of the  problem with shopping recommendations  where the information definitely becomes obsolete in a matter of few months, if not weeks as in case of nightly builds here.    I noticed that the  criteria of  automatic deletion of a question  isn't much helpful here.

 I have been reading a lot of "answers" that are merely someone's opinion or lazy guess.  If someone asks a specific question and you don't know the answer with authority then don't answer.  If you find yourself writing "I think..." or "Your best bet probably is..." or "I haven't tried this app so I don't know but..." then please promptly hold the backspace button down for a few seconds then click on the "x" in the upper right hand corner of your screen.    I don't necessarily think that someone has to have actually done something or used some solution before they can suggest it, but there is a line between giving a well reasoned suggestion and regurgitating what you read in the app market. I'm not sure where that line is, but I think it needs to be there.    I see this as more damaging to the site then the "Subjective" questions.    Am I way off based on this?

  cloud  and  delete  are frequently meta-ish tags: They're just words pulled from the question, rather than the useful categories that we want tags to be.    My view is that various cloud services have virtually nothing in common, so having a tag to group them all serves no purpose.  It's better to use specific tags like  dropbox , for example.    Izzy thought some combinations were useful, like  cloud  printing  or  cloud  backup .  I think those combinations are potentially useful categories, but would be better represented by a single tag like  cloud-printing .  There's not really a use case for filtering by  cloud , since  printing  and  backup  have in common; you wouldn't even use the same cloud service for both.    What say ye?

As a candidate, your job is simple - post an answer to this question, citing each of the questions and then post your answer to each question given in that same answer. For your convenience, I will include all of the questions in quote format with a break in between each, suitable for you to insert your answers. Just  copy the whole thing after the first set of three dashes . Oh, and please consider putting your name at the top of your post so that readers will know who you are before they finish reading everything you have written.    Once all the answers have been compiled, this will serve as a transcript for voters to view the thoughts of their candidates, and will be appropriately linked in the Election page.     Good luck to all of the candidates!                How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?       How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?       We have  a significant problem  where a question lacks some  critical details  - the details required to formulate a good answer, absence of which may restrict few users from considering posting a detailed answer. Those details are usually the Android version and Android device name, but not limited to them. Consider the fact that users  often  have to invest/waste their time into seeking those details - the details, which should have been provided by the user already or could have been asked from them via technical means. There exists clearly a problem to deal with, so...  What stance do you have on this issue?   What do you propose or have proposed to deal with this issue?        Moderators are given the power to unilaterally delete posts. Given this ability, how would you approach answers that are objectively low-quality (vague, short, etc) but are an attempt to provide an answer?       Are there any existing policies or rules that you think should be amended or removed? Are there any new policies you would like to see added?       You close a question that's clearly off-topic and the user comes to Meta, not to ask what they did wrong, say you're a [mean word here]. How do you react?       Even though we've a clear consensus on  Should users (non-Moderators) approve an edit made by a user posing as the author of the post?  you can still find two or three regular reviewers who do not go by that consensus and wrongly approve such edits. Other problem is with reviewing  where careless or superfluous edits gets approved , most likely to increase review count. How do you deal with such reviewers or with their reviewing? If you don't see a problem, please tell us why do you not find such reviews a problem at all.        Like every other site, we also suffer from lazy answers. The problem has been discussed here:  Half line answers -- what would be the best course of action(s) to deal with them?  The problem is different from  this issue  which is about lazy guesses or lazy opinions. None of the solutions to the original problem have gained support (through votes) that can be considered as will of the community at large. Consider the fact that no consensus causes or may be causing ambiguity to users from flagging those posts -  users, who are the major reason moderators are able to keep the site clean or keep a tab on quality of posts.  What are you going to do with answers similar in nature to the examples listed in that question?   What clear suggestion for dealing with those posts do you propose for ordinary users of this site?        If you're a regular here, you would have soon realized that we have  a huge  quite an issue of crappy migration from one of the larger SE sites. That site deals with questions posted by enthusiasts and power users of computers.  What is your stance on crappy migration? Do you have a preemptive solution? If yes, what is it? What do you suggest to regular flag raisers and close voters to do with such crap?       How do you define  Android independent questions ? The only available answer to the linked question doesn't seem to solve the original problem stated in the question.

 Today, a site-wide CSS update on badge tags took place, to "center" the text &amp; icon on badges which use the "circle" to denote bronze, silver, and gold.    We, on the other hand, use Android logos instead of dots.     The left padding on all badges increased, making all of "our" badges look off-center.     Here's what they looked like before:            How they look now:                Technical details:     Relevant CSS styling before:     .badge-tag {   padding: .4em .8em .4em .4em; }      And what they changed it to:     .badge-tag {   padding: .4em .8em; }      IMHO, I think our badges look the most centered with a small adjustment from the old version:     .badge-tag {   padding: .4em .8em .4em .5em; }      You can experiment with this by right-clicking on any badge in Chrome or Firefox and going to Inspector, and finding the  padding  attribute in there.       This is mainly an issue on the Android SE site, because all of the other sites took this change without much anybody noticing.    Is this is something we'll have to get used to? Or can this be customized (fixed) on our site?   Site-wide CSS updates ruin Android SE badge tags bug  status-completed  design 
 Why do we even have the tag  development  on AE? Because questions about writing or publishing apps, or ROMs are off-topic here.

  power  tag  doesn't have user guidance .  Lacking user guidance, it can be (mis) used for anything related to power without checking for suitable tags available, as is the case    Going through 52 questions in the tag and appropriately adding tags, I found the questions , mostly related to  power-on ,  power-options ,  charging ,  battery-lfe .

 Is this is a mistake or a deliberate move that the terms " regular people " are not mentioned in the  tour  ( record ) of the site? As of now it currently notes:         Android Enthusiasts Stack Exchange  is a question and answer site for enthusiasts and power users of the Android operating system.      On the other hand, in the page  what topics can I ask about here?  ( record ), one gets to see:         Android Enthusiasts Stack Exchange  is for enthusiasts, power users, and   regular people   who use the Android operating system.       (Emphasis mine)     Moreover, the said help center page now makes me wonder why do we not simply write:         Android Enthusiasts Stack Exchange  is for users of Android operating system.       Per  this question , I conclude that the terms " regular people " have been there for quite a long time, but I'm not sure whether the question notes the mention of the same in help center or tour in particular.    " Regular people " are also welcome on this site per  this post , so I don't see why the terms are missing from the tour?

 We have a lot of questions on the  broken-screen  tag, and they're all pretty similar but different. There are basically  n  variables, and you get a slightly different set of possible answers for each combination:-      only the display is broken, or only the touchscreen is broken, or they're both broken   USB debugging is already on or not   an Android version where you have to click a notification to allow MTP, or an older version   the user wants a full backup or just some files (just contacts, just SMSes)   device supports  usb-on-the-go  or not   full-device encryption or SD card encryption or neither      There's also a set of solutions, each of which is applicable to some subset of the situations. It makes it really hard for visitors to know where to look to find the answer to their question, and just as hard for us to triage new questions, determine if they're duplicates, and if so of which question.    How can we make this situation better? I'd like to get to a situation where it's easy to identify a list of possible solutions that are applicable to a given combination of factors, and to point visitors at that list.

 I haven't been a member of this community for very long, (or SE as a whole for that matter), however:    I feel that this site is going down the tubes. There are a ton of people asking low quality questions about rooting, why something doesn't work in a custom ROM...    I could be wrong, but I doubt those types of questions will EVER get an accepted answer.    Even this question, that I asked, and which I believe is completely on-topic, has been ignored:  WiFi direct on 5Ghz band?     Therefore, I'd like to propose one of two things:      Rooting, custom ROMs and the like become off-topic   There is a separate category exclusively for these types of questions.     Direction of the site? discussion  feature-request 
 I have come to notice that although we have a flag-to-close reason for questions related to ROM development, the help center's  on topic page  does not do a good job at all of showing that. See the development and expressly off-topic sections (reproduced below):        What if I have a question about Android development?        Development/programming questions are not covered on this site. You can visit our sister site, Stack Overflow, instead.        What about other Android-related questions?        The following topics are expressly   off-topic   here:             Marketing your Android app or doing market research       Issues with the Google Play Store (or any other app marketplace) from the point of view of a developer or publisher       Questions asking the community to find or recommend something for you (a device, app, ROM, website, etc), including what to buy and where to buy it       Speculative questions, like "When will X be available in my country?" or "Why does Company X do this?"       Legal questions, such as "Will X void my warranty?"       Android-independent questions, such as "Does Carrier X have prepaid plans?"           Development is covered, but I suspect some more stubborn ones will object to the fact that ROM development/modification  ex-situ  can't be off-topic as "development" is misconstrued by them to mean "app development".    My proposal: Can we reword the "Development" section of the on-topic page to go something like:     App and ROM development (including modification of existing ROMs in a manner enabling redistribution)..."      Too much legal-proofing there. Please do suggest something more natural if possible.     Edit:    I forgot to add the reasoning behind this.    It's somewhat like, someone flags to close a question based on the fact that it is about ROM development, and leaves a comment on the matter, with a direction to the help center's on-topic page, as the auto-review comments do. Now if someone goes through the link, he/she may find no explicit mention of ROM development, and protest the comment, all since the question has not been closed yet (the "closed" message and the reasons there mentioned aren't shown), so the reason for the close flag  has no official justification .    Alternative proposal:    I do not disagree with the text of the custom close reason, it is most definitely to the point and unambiguous. In this context, I suggest that the "Development" section of the help center page have its contents mirror the custom close reason, which goes:        Questions about writing and publishing Android apps, writing custom ROMs, and other topics that are primarily of concern to developers are off topic.     ROM development off-topic, but not clear in the help center feature-request  close-reasons  help-center

  sync  &times; 14     synchronization  &times; 2    One question actually has both tags.    I think "sync" is used more because, well, it's a simple abbreviation and the full word is hard to spell.

 Electronic Gadget got  shut down for several reasons , partly due to lousy stats         How're WE doin'?    As of Sept 30, 2010:     * 585   questions * 1,187 answers * 79%   answered * 557   users * 997   views/day           As of October 9:         My observations:      Our number of questions is excellent   Our question:answer ratio needs some improvement   Our user-count needs improvement, but Gadgets represented two months (plus?) of public beta; we're at only three weeks, and users keep getting added. So no worries.   Our views/day is dropping? Does anybody have actual stats tracking, instead of these two, random snapshots?

 Factory reset protection is a hot new feature, and one that's catching a lot of people out, judging by how many questions we get about how to get around it.    These questions are all asking pretty much the same thing, but the answer depends strongly on what phone is involved (and will change for different firmware versions too). The situation is somewhat analogous to "how do I root my phone?" or "how do I install a custom ROM?" questions, and like those topics, I think there's a risk of these questions getting messy. Unlike "how do I root my device?" we should expect that the answer for the majority of phones will simply be "you just can't", so I'm not sure if the "one question per phone" approach will work here: we'd end up with a lot of unanswered questions. OTOH, it's likely that if someone discovers a way to bypass it for a phone where it was previously thought impossible, they might ask and self-answer a question about that phone, and I think we want to encourage that (rather than closing the question and making them merge the answer by hand).    Matthew Read's  answer  is pretty close to being a  canonical answer  for this question, but the question it's on is for one phone only, and of course the answer only deals with a small selection of phones. I'm not sure that trying to edit this question to be more generic and then making the answer  community wiki  is the right thing to do here; nor does breaking up the existing good answer into answers on separate per-phone questions.    I'm a bit lost about what we should do, and I think that now is the time to act, before we have a spaghetti dish of overlapping questions to clean up. I'd like to hear the community's opinions on what's the best option, or to hear some new and better options.   What shall we do with "how to bypass FRP" questions? discussion  questions

 According to the FAQ, these questions are disallowed:        Questions that are primarily opinion-based, such as device or app recommendations or speculative questions      I understand that asking "which notes app should I use?" is a poor question because it is entirely subjective, because different people will have different criteria of why you  should  or  should not  use a certain app.    But consider a question like this:        What apps are there to make toast with Android?

  We closed the  domain naming thread (click for details) .      Instead,  let's start with a killer "elevator pitch!"  Joel will be blogging about the elevator pitch approach to naming, but to get you started:     The Elevator Pitch    This isn't as easy as it sounds. Imagine the user who will never read your FAQ and you have two seconds to grab their attention. It should be catchy but descriptive. It should be thoroughly clear but painfully concise.  Make every... word... count.      Here are some creative examples:        Gawker : Daily Manhattan media news and gossip. Reporting live from the center of the universe.     Gizmodo : The gadget guide. So much in love with shiny new toys, it’s unnatural.     Autoblog : We obsessively cover the auto industry.     DumbLittleMan : So what do we do here? Well, it’s simple. 15 to 20 times per week we provide tips that will save you money, increase your productivity, or simply keep you sane.     Needcoffee.com : We are the Internet equivalent of a triple espresso with whipped cream. Mmmm…whipped cream.       Use it as a Tagline    A shorter elevator pitch  can  be used as a tagline&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;something you can display in the header at the top of the page. If it doesn't fit, consider shortening it or creating a separate tagline. Here are some great examples:        Slashdot : News for nerds. Stuff that matters.     Lifehacker : Don’t live to geek, geek to live!     The Simple Dollar : Financial talk for the rest of us.       The Motto (don't forget your logo)    A logo begs for it own little, short tagline&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;like a motto. Maybe the tagline inspires the logo; Maybe it's the other way around. Mottos make good t-shirt, bumper stickers, and other marketing material. Either way, you'll recognize a good motto when you see it:       Just do it.    Think Different.    The Uncola.    Intel inside.    Like a rock.    The king of beers.       &hellip;and perhaps all this leads to a proper name and domain for your site&hellip;  eventually . So let's start from the basics.

And they would be off-topic anyway if the question deals with the beta program itself.    So how do we want to deal with a) that tag and b) questions using it?

 This is a sibling to  How should we handle obsolete answers?  – but with a completely different focus: while the answers there are simply not longer valid for Android versions newer than X – I'm asking about answers which became completely invalid.

 Throughout the beta, we need members from the site whose focus is to engage the community, both in community-building issues and site management. That's why we select a few members from each community to act as temporary, provisional Moderators. You can read about the program here:   Moderators Pro Tempore  .    I am pleased to announce that these members have stepped up and generously volunteered their time to help us assure that each community’s issues are properly addressed:               We want to make this site a huge success, and these members are great examples of exactly the type of people we need to make this site succeed. Please welcome them for the hard work and time they contribute.    Did I overlook anyone?    Almost certainly. There are members who are actively involved and very deserving of recognition. My failure to account for everyone this early on is in  no way  a slight against them.

 When my mouse hovers over a vote (up/down) button or “favorite” in Chrome 53, there is a very annoying visual effect where the button “pops out” (becomes slightly bigger, then back to the original size) for a fraction of a second.  I'm told that this is by design .    Ok, but it's extremely annoying. How can I turn it off?    I've successfully turned off the animation when clicking an up/downvote button with user CSS (I wish I didn't have to copy this to every browser, though):     a.vote-up-off {     transition: none !important; } a.vote-up-on {     transition: none !important; } a.vote-down-off {     transition: none !important; } a.vote-down-on {     transition: none !important; }      But I can't figure out how to turn off the animation that happens on mouse hover.

 Stack Exchange recently started a collaboration project with the University of Melbourne, in an attempt to improve the automatic detection of duplicate questions.    More information on the project and a call for help from the community can be found here:  Project Reduplication of Deduplication Has Begun!     In it, Tim Post mentions that Doris Hoogeveen (me) will post a message on the different meta sites to let you know that we're ready for help. This is it!    As a brief summary, the project is about finding ways to automatically determine if two questions are duplicates, and also to detect the opposite: falsely tagged duplicates. To validate our methods, we need manual judgements from people who really know the data. This is where we need your help. It is impossible to manually annotate all the data from Stack Exchange, and so we have applied several filters to make sure we only show you questions pairs with a high likelihood of being duplicates.    Participation is completely optional, and there's no minimum time requirement. If you are interested in participating in the project, please head over to the annotation interface, which can be found here:  http://hum.csse.unimelb.edu.au/se-annotate/     You can log in with your Stack Exchange account, so no sign up is required. The site also contains some more information on the project, which might answer some questions you may have. And I'm also happy to answer them here.    Thank you!

 The Gingerbread SDK is rumored to get released on November 11. Shortly thereafter I expect there will be a flood of questions "when will {phone X} get Android 2.3?" We're still getting questions like that for Froyo.    My idea is to have one Community Wiki question: "When will my phone get Android 2.3 (Gingerbread)?" that will contain as many models and dates as we can find. Many of us read a lot of Android blogs; whenever a new date is announced (even if it's a rumor) we can edit the question to have that information, with links to sources. (Alternatively, we could have answers for each phone model, but I think that would get unwieldy.) That way, we can then close every other question about an individual phone and point it to the CW question.    And, of course, being Community Wiki will allow more people to be able to edit it.    Thoughts?    Update: It would probably be worthwhile to have a Froyo question too. There are still devices out there waiting for that upgrade.

 With all the tablets coming out and all the manufacturers trying to "improve" Android with their own custom UIs, I think it would be useful to document what UIs are running on devices, how intrusive they are and links to any other options.  I haven't seen this anywhere and this could be a useful resource to the community, and pre-empt a lot of questions.      I recently bought a Viewsonic G-table which claims to be running Android 2.2 but when I got it I discovered that their TapNTapUI was so intrusive and clunky that you'd never know it was running Android at all, or that it had a Tegra2 processor.  If I didn't know better I would have thought it was an old Oregon Scientific PIM with a really big and pretty screen.  I'm returning it and have ordered an Archos 70, however it took a long time to research exactly what "improvements" (perversions) Archos has made to the UI and how deeply ingrained they are (supposedly, they are only minor changes that you wouldn't notice).    This may be a little ambitious in scope and beyond the focus of this platform but I can definitely see a bunch of granular questions like...       "Is the Archos 70 running a proprietary UI?"     "How do I remove the TapNTapUI on the G-Tablet?"    "What tablets are loaded with Vanilla Android?"      ... and the benefit to rolling them all into a wiki would be creating link bait and keyword rich posts that would help bring people in.

 Hey guys,    I just thought of a pretty good idea in my opinion after reading a question like  this  for the 10th time.    What if we start small Wiki posts for certain popular categories like:      Music Players   Video Players   Home Screen Launchers   SMS apps   more...      We could list apps that are the most popular on the market these days and have small sentences describing the app and what makes it unique/popular. This would be a good reference for people interested in same Music Players to go and find the popular ones out there and what their differences are.    What do you guys think?    NB. We could make certain conditions for app to be listed like... they must have over say 5,000 downloads and a minimum rating of 3 stars just to cut out the junk apps.

 I am trying to be a productive member of this website and I'm having a problem with the reputation system.    Now I don't have a problem with the reputation system as a whole, I find that it works well.  I am familiar with it as I am also a member at StackOverflow.    My problem is this:  Twice now I've wanted to comment on an answer or vote it up because it didn't seem to be getting the votes or recognition that it needed.  But, since I didn't have enough reputation I have no real choice but to leave another answer with a nod to the previous answer.  Both times I was voted down, leaving me that much further from being able to vote up or leave comments.    Here are the two questions and answers:     How can I locate my Android device around the house?      https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/2935/best-screen-protector-htc-desire-z/2942#2942     In the second one I was very explicit in my answer about why I was posting an answer, but I was still down-voted.    So, what am I supposed to do?  How am I supposed to help the community find the right answers when I can't steer them towards them?  I post as much as I feel is necessary and no more.  I'm not going to go around posting in every question I find just to get lucky and get an up-vote.  That's not helpful to the community.    In Al Everett's  post about voting , he lists reasons to vote down an answer.  It does not say anything about a duplicate answers.    So, what to do besides posting the odd answer and hope that it is up-voted?    It is really discouraging me from trying to participate.    My thoughts:  Perhaps any answer should give the poster one or two reputation points in order to encourage participation.  Otherwise, I don't quite see the point.

 This one comes to mind after seeing  this question .    Historically almost every bump of  Android API version  warrants a new tag, but when Android 4.0.3 dawned as a "minor" version of Android 4.0  but  comes with API15 instead of API14, there's no designated tag for it. I assume this is because that the lifespan of API14 is too short (2 months) to be of use to discussion, thus  4.0-ice-cream-sandwich  remains.    Now, minus the preview period, Android 7.0 (API24) has a lifespan even shorter than that of API14, then gave way to Android 7.1 (API25). In this sense Android 7.1 is definitely the way to go in future discussions. Should we create this tag and make  7.0-nougat  a synonym to it, or the other way round?   Is the tag "7.1-nougat" necessary? discussion  tags 
 Every now and then we see some questions of very low quality. The question is 70% venting and/or panic and begging and include no information about the device itself or the Android version.    We have  how do I ask a good question  but let's face it, most newcomers don't read such stuff, even the  tour .    Even though I know it won't one hundred percent prevent such things, I think placing a pre-formatted template shadow question might be useful for new and noob users. We already use this method at the  profile parts of our user pages  which  -in my opinion-  needs it much less than the question page.    I'm no psychologist but since people come with the intention of being walked through, I think this can be a way to guide them to ask better formatted questions and thus raise the general quality average of questions.    For example something like this:     Your problem: My phone is stuck on a bootloop after rooting with Kingoroot.  Things you tried so far: I tried to boot into recovery however I failed.

 I'd like to see more discussion on the scope of topics for Android.SE.  We have established that the site is for "enthusiasts, power users, and regular people too using the Android operating system" and not for "programming questions," but I think we could use a little more discussion about where those particular boundaries actually are.  We should also continue to discuss the topic of "Subjective" questions, CWs and "Lists."      I know for some people this is all black and white but just watching the habits of the active users it is clear that there is a lot different opinions out there.  Even among the mods there seems to be a variety of views on this.

 There are rare cases where one has to (or "strongly wants to") reach out to a mod directly/personally. I understand (and want to emphasize!) these should be exceptions, and a mod should not be  forced  into it – but still, such cases exist (in my 3.5+ years here on Android.SE I felt in that situation 2 times – and you know I'm quite active here; this should show the exception of the need). So how can that be achieved?      on many/most other sites, there's at least one mod available in the site's chat room (or was shortly, so (s)he can be @ pinged). Not so on Android.SE: I cannot remember when I last saw one of our mods in our room. Must be at least 2 years ago.   being a mod myself, I of course know about TL. Unfortunately, same situation there; and in some cases one doesn't want to @@ there (or address all mods), to keep the ball low (e.g. now dirty laundry in public ;). There's the possibility to create a "private chat room" and invite – but I'm not sure if that's reserved for mods.   in some cases, a @ ping doesn't even require a direct response (example: having flagged a question for mod attention, and wanting to add some (important) details forgotten: a second flag isn't permitted by the system, so a simple @ in chat might do)   we've got no such thing as PM on SE      So let me put my question into separate bullet points:      Wouldn't it be a good idea if at least one of the mods can be found in our chat room? What speaks against it? If it's your (the mods) workload, you know you can ask for reinforcement. I then might even volunteer and nominate myself to fulfill my own request :)   Do you rather "keep out of reach" for a reason – or, put into other words, is it generally "unwanted" on SE to reach out to a mod this way?      This is nagging me for the better of a year now. Thus, unable to reach you otherwise, I've decided to bring it up here on Meta (which should be the right place, especially as I'm certainly not the only one with this question in mind).    Please don't get me wrong: this is not a rant, nor am I wanting to blame/accuse someone (some of us have a real-life outside SE as well, unbelievable as it might sound, so there's definitely the possibility of a good reason ;) But having background and advice on this topic pointed out clearly (whichever direction) will certainly be of help.

 Whenever I want to check out and answer a few questions about the Android OS, I'm always seeing questions like 'Can't connect to my Facebook account', 'Recover photos from Gallery Vault' and 'Twitter not posting tweets', which I have no idea at all about providing an answer.

In my opinion most should go to either their developer feedback hub or their special discussion forums, so why are so much allowed here?  P.S.

I was going to edit the answer to either remove KingoRoot from it, or add a warning message next to it, but I figured that in cases other than #4 my edit would do harm instead of good, so I decided to ask first.   Is the list of rooting methods supposed to contain bloatware? discussion  questions

 Following on from  Android.SE is on a good track, but we need to work to ensure it survives the beta , we are now right on  Day 90  of our beta. This is the traditional end of beta day on StackExchange, and there's no sign of us launching yet.    I realize that there is no actual absolute pass/fail happening on the 90th day, this entry from the StackExchange blog covers that  When will my site graduate , but we have reached a good milestone to look at ourselves and think what we need to do to make sure that we do graduate.    How are we doing?    According to our  page on Area 51 , we're sitting at Good or Excellent on all stats:         What can we do to help?    A lot of this is going to be hard to improve on without attracting a lot more, quality, members to the site. This is where a bit of marketing and self-promotion could go a long way. We need people to ask good questions, and we need people to give good answers (that will be accepted by the questioner).    One easy way to help that anyone can do is to vote. We need more high-rep users to help moderate the site. Vote on good quality, well written, interesting questions, and vote on good-quality, helpful answers. See  What does voting mean and why is it important?  If you need any further incentive, there are badges available for the first time you use all of your 30 daily votes up, and one for when you've voted 300 times.    What else should we be doing?    There are  7 essential questions that every beta site should be asking . have we asked all of them? Have we answered all of them in any satisfactory way?    Some of them have been pretty thoroughly thrashed out in various ways, some of them I don't think we've even touched on:      Are questions about [subject] on or off topic?     Ok, a variety of meta posts go through various aspects of on/off topic, I think we're ok here.      What should our FAQ contain?     Other than discussion of a  Getting Started Guide  I don't think we've really been into this?      How should we tag questions about {subject}?     Again tagging's been a frequent topic on meta, I think we're covered here.      What’s the “elevator pitch” for our site?     This question needs revisiting just to make sure the answers are up to date and we're all happy with them  Write an Elevator Pitch / Tagline        What should our logo and site design look like?

We must have an artist or two in our community?      Who should the moderators be?

 There is a  Google proposal  in Area 51. It was proposed on December 11th so it's still quite new. It's scope is currently defined as:        Google web apps, desktop software, and   Android and Chrome OS      One of the comments on the proposal page suggested that the creator should attempt to appeal to this site in order to expand this sites focus, rather than create a new semi-related site.

 I'm not certain when it was updated but the Android Tag on SO now lists AE for user-related questions. The tag's About page was also updated.

 As Android Enthusiasts Stack Exchange is not for Android development, why is there still  development  this tag? Does this tag, to some extent, mean "Asking to close this question"?

 A lot of questions are posted in which there is a bare minimum of information and someone almost always comments and says to add details such as Android device, Android version, etc. This fine but it would be better if these details were present in the first place.     Is there some way in which we could make it clear to users that they should add these details if required when they ask a question?     The How To Ask guide in the Help Center says:         Be specific         If you ask a vague question, you’ll get a vague answer. But if you give us details and context, we can provide a useful answer.      Which is true but perhaps it could specify which details users could include. I understand that there isn't a single list of details that suit every question, which is why the detail list could include suggestions or examples. Many questions would benefit from these general details and  too much  detail is never a bad thing.    Of course, we can never guarantee that users will actually read the Help Center pages (see  this question ) so maybe a different approach to this issue would be better.   How can we ensure that users include relevant detail when asking a question? discussion  feature-request  help-center

 Android as an operating system dates back to 2008, and the first viable Android version (arguably), Gingerbread, was out circa 2011, 6 years earlier. Android.SE itself also has a ~7-year history.    During the course, many questions on meaningful topics have been asked, some could even be considered some sort of "FAQ", as the issue persists across many Android versions, and people outside SE are constantly flowing in (via search) looking for a solution. However, as Android version progresses rapidly and brings a lot of changes with each version, the solution proposed back then might not be as elegant or effective by "modern" standards. This part of the dilemma had been discussed  here .    While I was reviewing close votes recently, I start to notice some duplicate votes, referencing such old questions as its duplicate "target", but the way I see it, the answers there are too outdated or general to be of reference value. Occasionally, there are also factors in the dupe "suspect" that's a result of the advancing of Android or the software in question, and not part of the dupe "target". Marking as dupe in this way won't help the author of the dupe "suspect" get much clue, and his question will probably get closed before it attracts careful inspection from knowledgeable people.    I personally feel that, after a certain time threshold, we should either direct our effort to updating such old questions  before  we assign them as dupe "targets", or when we can't, we should not even check the mark in the first place, but instead leave them as a platform for up-to-date answers to grow on.

 Most devices from the same generation from the same manufacturer have very similar or even totally identical configuration, hardware or software. Solutions to problems for one device almost always appliesto others in the same series.

They can be merged into their "parent" tags (in this case,  google-play-store ).      Alternative solution: Leave these mess in their place. No one will care about this chaotic site.      P.S.

 When going through the "suggested edit" queue, one in particular (now deleted) got me thinking. It was an answer post that was made in a language other than English, but it wasn't an answer to the question: it was a classic "I have the same problem" post.    Per  StackExchange policy , English is required in all posts. However, it's also quite obvious (especially to frequent reviewers) that there are non-English posts flowing in every once in a while. Most if not all of them are meaningless, in the way of "I have the problem too" or "thank you".    I agree that, if the non-English post is meaningful, we should devote effort to at least a rough translation; however, the example I gave above is the first time I've seen someone trying to translate a post of such low-quality type. Given the fact that such posts will be deleted shortly, are such suggested edits acceptable/encouraged, and are we as reviewers still supposed to approve the edits?   Are translations to low quality posts acceptable as suggested edits? discussion  suggested-edits 
 I recently posted this question:     How to share internet among 2 android devices?     And through the miracle of Android Enthusiasts, came up with the answers needed.  However, the question started as, essentially "connect 2 android devices" but the answers wound up depending on the specific devices (for example, the config file for the tablet may very well be tablet-specific;  I know that other android devices require additional edits to config that the tablet did not).  Should I edit the question to reflect more exactly the answers, something like "How To Connect my Archos Gentouch 78 tablet to my G1's internet connection" or leave it in its more general format?

 I am an Android enthusiast who owns an Archos 43 Internet Tablet, which doesn't include any 3G/4G or phone capability out of the box.    I want to learn more about Android, but some of the questions on this site seem to be very phone-centric, such as  When will Google Nexus S be available in Belgium (Europe) ,  Can I get Nexus S in Canada? ,  What are the best android phones available in India?     I'm just wondering if there is a way to filter this stuff out if it really does belong here.  I'm interested in the OS, not someone's phone buying decisions.   Is asking about retail availability of a phone REALLY an Android question? discussion 
 I'm currently looking forward to buying a new phone. I'm not sure if asking here is appropriate or not, so I decided to ask on this meta post.    I am aware that I should't ask too broad or primarily opinion based questions here. I checked out  Can we ask for genuine reviews of an Android Phone here?  and it was mentioned there:        This is because shopping questions have no one definite answer, and as such are a bad fit for a question/answer site. Each user has their own preferences and use patterns, and therefore the answers can't be really considered universal.      If suppose I did mention what I require in a phone, and give a priority to what properties I prefer in a phone, would it be reasonable to ask here? I always prefer to ask neat and clean questions with no ambiguity. I refrain from asking vague questions like "What's the best android phone under ₹15k?", but rather I prefer to ask questions like "Can anyone suggest phones with over 13MP camera and over 3GB RAM?".    IF these questions are inappropriate here, where can I ask them?   Can I ask questions regarding suggesting Android phones with specifications that I mention? support  scope

 I raised  2  spam  flags  for  a guy 's posts. My reasons for considering those as spams are below       He claims he's the developer of the software he's recommending ( See his post ).      The app  costs US$0.99 on Google Play, and is  newly submitted  (June 17, 2017).     This guy has no questions, and  only  2 answers, both of which are recommending the app, and their contents are  almost identical . In other words, if he  had  posted other questions or answers, I  wouldn't  have considered him as a spammer.     His display name,  Smaj Enterprise , is exactly the same as the publisher name on Google Play.

 It's been the case for a long time that questions about installing and using the development tools for Android - adb, fastboot, the emulator - and the infrastructure behind installing and updating them - the SDK manager - are on-topic on this site. The rationale for this is that often, these tools are used for non-development purposes. Power users might use adb for changing settings on the device, for controlling it from a PC, or for backups. They might use the emulator to investigate an app without installing it, or to use an app their device doesn't support. And of course fastboot is often used for installing custom ROMs, or for upgrading Android by hand if an OTA upgrade is not available.    That said, I've seen a lot of flags and close-votes recently asking for questions of this type to be closed as development questions. Does this represent a change in the views of the community? Should we start treating these questions as off-topic?    I'm keen to hear lots of people's views about this, to form a consensus.

 What does marking a post or a question as "Community Wiki" signify?    What are the implications?

 I've found several question which is tagged with the phone model of the poster, but the tag does not help describe or classify the question. Example  1   2 . In those question the tags serve no other purpose than to inform the reader of the user's phone model (in case it matters). This is in contrast to  this question  where the phone model is a relevant sorting/classification criteria for the question.    I think this falls under the definition of  meta-tags  which have been discouraged and removed from SO and the other main sites. To quote an argument used there (see  this ):        There’s been a major uptick recently in tags that are not useful   and just add noise. I want to stress   that these are usually added in good   faith, and I am not questioning   anybody’s motivation – I know that   they all mean well. But this   particular category of tags is one   that has been historically referred to   as meta-tags on MSO, and these tags   cause a lot of problems.        The reason meta-tags are a problem is that they do not describe the   content of the question. They describe   some other aspect of the question,   like the author’s skill level, or the   author’s motivation for asking it, or   generally what “kind” of question it   is (poll, how-to, etc.).        Meta-tags are actually a subset of a larger problem that I usually call   dependent tags. These are tags that   don’t say anything by themselves – you   can’t tell what the question is about   unless they’re paired with some other   tag (or several of them). These tags   are a problem because people don’t   realize this and will often use that   as the question’s only tag.      Another one:        The point of tags on Stack Overflow is   to help other interested persons find   your question by sorting it into   clear, specific categories. This is   not the same as indexing or   summarizing the question. The   differences are subtle, but important.

 I just opened the Android Stack Exchange site to link someone to it and when I saw it I thought the page hadn't loaded properly. This is what I saw (you'll want to view full size, they're uploaded full-size):                  Perhaps on some monitors it looks ok, but on both my laptop screen and my external monitor it's  very  hard to read.

 There's a question on the site concerning  tethering detection  (on the part of mobile carriers). The accepted answer ranks highly for searches on this topic and is often cited on sites like reddit.    The section on detection via MAC address is blatantly wrong and suggests a misunderstanding of network fundamentals. Yes, at the physical layer there is a concept of a MAC address - but the phone will be doing NAT when tethering! Numerous comments have identified this issue. Ideally this entire paragraph needs removing or at least considerably revising.    Unfortunately the question is locked, and as I discovered in the chat, no edits can be made.

 In the last couple of questions I filed in here at AE I was advised to solve my issues by acquiring a Microsoft Windows licence.     I have been struggling to get TWRP to boot on one of my devices and on a first a reaction a user  directed me to do it with Windows . While I regard this mostly as a raw attempt to help, even after I succeeded in flashing TWRP to the device from my system the same user  kept promoting Microsoft Windows .    In  a follow up question  I specifically stated I am not willing to acquire a Microsoft Windows licence. This lead not only to more promotion of Microsoft's system, but even to  a clear hint to use it illegally .    I do not regard the behaviour of these two users particularly malicious (one at least is clearly trying to help), they are possibly just being somewhat careless. In other StackExchange sites this kind of behaviour would be less welcomed. So the question boils down to how tolerable this sort of product promotion should be at AE.

 Every Android device model is identified by a device code that is widely used (and potentially Googled, or at least returns a lot of results) among specialists/professionals.    E.g. Samsung Galaxy S3 is known with code  GT-I9300 , Motorola Nexus 6 is  shamu , Huawei MediaPad M2 10.0 as  M2-A01L     For the record, I have just tried to create a tag  m2-a01l  (typoed, I have a related question on renaming).    My question here is: does it have sense to create tags and/or synonims according to the device model code to help search engines find questions/answer on that model?    Consider that I took some time to start searching for  shamu rooting ,  m2-a01l stock firmware  etc. A number of topics on  xda  report the model code for the device in their  [tags] , but XDA is a technical forum while Android SE is for everyone.    Those searches are  mainly  related to ROM stuff. I don't think people search for  how to uninstall app in shamu ,  shamu broken glass     To be more clear in my question, it is my opinion that advanced users may  also  want to search for content by the model code, while everyday Android users/enthusiast may just prefer to use the model name    Any thoughts?

 Over the past few days, a particular user have been submitting a lot of suggested edits (both on the main site and Meta) that changes all SE links in the post from  http  to  https  - example  here .    While I agree that such edits are generally beneficial security-wise, I recall that when the shift to  https  happened, the site automatically did most of the modifications, and thus I think such type of changes should be left for the site management system, rather than being a chance to accumulate edit count and rake in renown.

 These two questions were asked back in android.SE's infancy:       Can you recommend some alternative keyboards for Android?     What is the best alternative to the stock camera app?

Considering how long they've been around and how much interaction they've gotten do you think they should be closed or made community wikis?

 So we seem to get questions every now and then from people who want to know about running Android on devices that originally came with some other OS (normally some flavour of WinMobile). Normally we aren't much more help to the asker than pointing them at some year-old thread on XDA, if we can even be that helpful.    Is there anything more we can do here, can we create a central "these non-Android phones can run Android" post, or is it not worth the effort?

 As everyone knows, back in the CyanogenMod days, we flagged questions about nightly releases, as they used to become obsolete fairly quickly and were too unstable to discuss.    Now, a similar situation presents itself to us: unofficial Xposed releases. As can be read in  this  XDA post, unofficial Xposed flashable  .zip  files are now a reality  for those who wish an early taste of Xposed on Nougat. While this may seem fantastic for the most adventurous of us, it also brings up a whole new array of issues which cannot be thoroughly classified. As rovo89, developer of Xposed, puts it,        The worst thing about this is that the exact behavior would depend on   the ROM, or even how the user uses the device (now that apps are   compiled based on profiles). Modules would fail randomly and the   module developers would be wondering what they did wrong (answer:   nothing). If not all of the prerequisites are fulfilled, it’s a pretty   unreliable API.      It's evident that we, as well as module devs, would not be able to address questions about devices with said Xposed flavor. Most importantly, even if we did, such questions wouldn't even be consistent among users with the same device.     Given the above, what stance should we take about questions featuring unofficial Xposed variants?  Note that this won't just apply to Xposed for Nougat, but for  any  unofficial Xposed in the future.   Questions about unofficial Xposed discussion  questions 
 This is a followup to Matt's question  Questions that are on the fence between development and power use  In that question, there is a general agreement that we "keep a big tent" and allow  some  types of Android development questions. This meta question seeks to establish a line between Android Development questions that should be accepted here and questions which are definitely off topic.    It has been acknowledged from time to time that certain development questions are best fit in Android.SE than StackOverflow or Programmers.SE; when we closed those sort of questions here and send it to SO, they often get closed again on SO and get sent back to us. Getting ping-ponged like that feels just like those crappy customer service (we can do better than those poor guys, can't we?). Additionally, as Matt pointed in  Questions that are on the fence between development and power use , developers are often very well suited to answer certain definitely-on-topic questions, so it is best for A.SE to attract some Android developers. However, we also do not want this to be a full-fledged developer site.    Here's what I think:    Development Question to keep at Android.SE:      How do I upload apps to Market?   What programming/scripting languages can I use to program for Android?    When is Android x.x SDK going to be released?  (as GAThrawn pointed out, this question is speculative since Google usually do not announces their SDK release dates)   What API Level/SDK version is feature X introduced?   How to use developer tool X (e.g. ADB) for non-developer use Y (e.g. side-loading apps)   How to use {Android-specific shell command (e.g. pm, am)}?   How to change X in custom ROM Y?      Borderline (determine on case-by-case basis):      Why does program X, which says it received Intent Y, is not receiving my Intent Y?   Why is my GPS application not getting good location in Android X, though it worked perfectly in Android Y?      Development Question to migrate to somewhere else:      Help me figure out how to write this algorithm for my Android app (off-topic to Stackoverflow)   How do I write {syntax X} in my Java Android program (off-topic to Stackoverflow)   Which is the better UI (off-topic to UI.SE)   How to use {linux shell command (e.g. toolbox/busybox commands)}?

I had posted the question;  Automatically disable mobile hotspot when no device is connected, using Tasker , but later found the question on these sites:        http://eadiscussion.com/index.php?threads/automatically-disable-mobile-hotspot-when-no-device-is-connected-using-tasker.7490/#post-7490       https://tutel.me/c/android/questions/170790/automatically+disable+mobile+hotspot+when+no+device+is+connected+using+tasker        to mention a few...    My question is, is this kind of behavior allowed or  has Stack Exchange given permission to such sites in order to republish the  content?  To my surprise there is even no referral link to the SE site from where the content was extracted and also the sites have no convincing detail that reveal their affiliation with SE (if any)?

 Over the last hours  one particular user  has posted a series of answers under app-related questions. While the answer themselves are not always completely unrelated to the question itself (I'm being conservative here), all of them has one or more links, either claimed to point to "premium" app downloads or video guides, but all wrapped in a revenue-generating (advertisement) URL shortener.    (Not to mention the download links are hosted under Google Drive, which does not guarantee the safety of the source; by "premium" and "cracked" this also implies piracy; those are separate issues)    For now I've flagged all answers from him that doesn't address the question itself properly as VLQ. I'm thinking of flagging all as spam as well, but at the same time it doesn't seem to fit well. I will also edit all these answers to remove the layer of URL shortener to directly expose the link if it's proper (regardless of whether it's on point - leaving it for other reviewers who are seeing my flags), or remove the link altogether if it's related to app piracy.    With StackExchange's editor, I don't believe a URL shortener is necessary in the first place, let alone one that could make money off the visitors to the site.    What's your stance on this?

 In connection with the moderator elections, we will be holding a Q&amp;A with the candidates.  This will be an opportunity for members of the community to pose questions to the candidates on the topic of moderation.  Participation is completely voluntary.         The purpose of this thread was to collect questions for the questionnaire. The questionnaire is now live, and you may find it  here .       Here's how it'll work:       During the nomination phase, (so, until Monday, March 21st at 20:00:00Z UTC, or 4:00 pm EDT on the same day, give or take time to arrive for closure), this question will be open to collect potential questions from the users of the site. Post answers to this question containing any questions you would like to ask the candidates. Please only post  one question per answer .     We, the Community Team, will be providing a small selection of generic questions. The first two will be guaranteed to be included, the latter ones are if the community doesn't supply enough questions. This will be done in a single post, unlike the prior instruction.     This is a perfect opportunity to voice questions that are specific to your community and issues that you are running into at current.     At the end of the phase, the Community Team will select  up to 8 of the top voted questions submitted by the community  provided in this thread, to use in addition to the aforementioned 2 guaranteed questions. We reserve some editorial control in the selection of the questions and may opt not to select a question that is tangential or irrelevant to moderation or the election. That said, if I have concerns about any questions in this fashion, I will be sure to point this out in comments before the decision making time.     Once questions have been selected, a new question will be opened to host the actual questionnaire for the candidates, containing 10 questions in total.     This is not the only option that users have for gathering information on candidates. As a community, you are still free to, for example, hold a live chat session with your candidates to ask further questions, or perhaps clarifications from what is provided in the Q&amp;A.       If you have any questions or feedback about this process, feel free to post as a comment here.   2016 Moderator Election Q&A - Question Collection discussion  election 
 Lately a few people have asked about a particular malware app. It's named "Chromes" to disguise it as a genuine app, "Chrome". The problem is, when you search for "Chromes" on the site, the search engine returns a lot of results about "Chrome": it's applying stemming to the name.    As a result, we get lots of duplicate questions about the same malware, and it's hard for reviewers to find the original question to mark as duplicate. It also means the "Related questions" aren't relevant at all.    Is there a way we can avoid stemming for this particular word, so that when people are searching for "Chromes" malware, they get relevant results? Or is there some other workaround to help people find relevant questions and avoid posting duplicates?   Can we avoid the search stemming "chromes"? feature-request  search 
 Looking at  this answer  which essentially says "No, there is not an app" but got comments saying "You know for a fact there are no coding games for Android?" implying that to answer "No" you must provide proof that none of the 200K android apps meet your needs.    Compared to  this question  which has no answers, but a comment that says "I've also looked and have not seen anything available at the moment.".   That comment is logically an answer, but it is an answer that says "No" and was posted by a mod.    Is there a preferred way to answer "No" to "Is there an App that does ABC?"?

 Closed questions aren't necessarily supposed to stay around forever.    On the non-Beta Stack Exchange sites, two days after a question is closed a "Delete" link goes live on the question, allowing users with more than 10K reputation to vote to delete. (This two day window allows the Asker an opportunity to edit their question and vote to re-open.)    Only some closed messages should be kept around. Duplicates should normally be kept in order to maximize the search terms that can be used to find the information. Questions that are almost  exact  duplicates should be merged.    Almost everything else, though, should be deleted. After all, if it had worth it wouldn't have been closed. If you think it  did  have worth, of course, vote to re-open.    In any event, your moderators can't be everywhere at once. If you see an old, closed (non-duplicate) question that needs deletion and you can't vote to delete yourself, please flag it for our attention.    Edit: Perhaps now that we have a bunch more people who can vote to delete, maybe we can get rid of some more of the egregiously awful questions. I like to use  this search  and go to the last page to get the lowest-voted questions. Of course, not all of them deserve deletion (and the "closed as duplicate" should stay) but it's a good place to start.

 Hi all. I'm  Jin , and I'll be working on the designs for the Stack Exchange sites as they graduate from the beta phase. Each site will have its own unique theme that will reflect its topic. However, all sites will share quite a bit of common elements so they feel like they're part of the Stack Exchange family.    I'm in the very early stage of brainstorming for design concepts of the Android.SE's official theme. I want to pitch some of my ideas to the community before I start t designing.        Overall look and feel: modern, clean and minimalist. The site should feel similar to the  user interface elements  found in most Android phones.     Use the  Android robot  as favicon or part of the header image, since we're allowed to use it legally.     Color scheme: white with black, yellow and green accent colors. Green from the Android Robot (#A4C639)     Typography: I'd like to use  Droid Sans  as the header and body text(via @font-face). However I need to make sure the font renders smoothly at a smaller size on Windows.        Please let me know what you think. Also feel free to post your own ideas. One thing I need to stress is that I'd like to focus on  ONE  overall look and feel. For now I feel the modern and slick one works well, since it represents Android UI. Feel free to disagree, but explain your argument.    Here are some of my questions for smaller details:       What should the tag and badge treatment be?     What should be used for the 404/error/captcha page images? I'm thinking about using the Android Robot for these, to keep a whimsical theme.     What are some of the Android related sites out there that you like(design wise). I've looked at quite a few, but haven't found any that stands out for me. Keep in mind, while I want the our site to look "Android-ish," but it's also important to give this community a distinct identity.       That's all, thanks!

 Yesterday I asked a question:     Decent Battery Monitoring App [closed]     It was closed because it's claimed to ask for shopping recommendation. Actually, I'm not asking for a shopping recommendation, but an app recommendation. Now I wonder why this question is not getting closed then?:      Must have applications for Android?      If what I asked is a shopping recommendation, then that one is asking even for more. Additionally, we have a [software-rec] tag on SuperUser and we think these kind of questions are quite useful. Note that "Shopping recommendations" are also off-topic on SuperUser.    IMO, there should be a difference (in other words, a line) between "shopping recommendations" and "software/app recommendations".     For example, this question totally asks for shopping recommendation, but it seems to be allowed here:     What are the least carrier-crippled Android phones?

This site is primarily a source to help people  use  their Android devices, whether it's an issue with hardware, software, a particular app, or even rooting. However, we get some other questions that don't fit here.    Yes, someone here might be able to help you, but you'll find that other forums and sites more focused on your topic can give you a much better answer than a bunch of Android geeks. It's likely that your question will be downvoted, closed, and in some cases marked "offensive." It's not that we hate you, it's just that we are trying to maintain the site's focus for maximum usability.    What forums can people go to to ask the questions that are off topic here? (Please list only  one  forum per answer so votes can bring the best forums to the top.)    Some potential topics might be:      shopping recommendations   phone hardware comparisons   mod support   news blogs   and so on       Questions about programming issues with Android belong on  Stack Overflow .

 I was reading the comments on  this post  and got a bit confused as to why JonnyP and travis were talking about Flipside and Motorola when the OP had a Droid Incredible.  Now to be fair had I not been skimming the comments I wouldn't have been confused - but it does seem odd to be discussing a different problem in the comments.  Now the comments there are kinda on-topic to be helpful to someone else (I think?). But if someone were to come across that again - let it go or ask them to move the conversation to chat/start a new post?  I don't mean to be a bully about it and its great that JonnyP is helping travis out but their comments are not helping the OP at all... right?  Please correct me if I'm wrong about this.

 I asked a  question  about booting into recovery mode  here  and tagged it with "t-mobile G1" because that's the device that was giving me grief and because I suspected that the phone manufacturer and model might be relevant to the answer. Looking at the answers, it does seem to be relevant: "Apparently download and recovery modes are merged for the G1."    Al Everett went through the other night and pulled the "t-mobile g1" tag off of most of my posts. In most cases I understand -- ultimately the questions and answers weren't G1 specific (though I didn't know that when I asked them). In this case the answer was so I'm curious about the logic behind pulling the tag. Thanks!   Why did someone pull the device tag from this question? discussion  tags

 Thank you for  your help  on the design brainstorm session. Below are the mockups for the final site theme based on some of the ideas we talked about.    (please click on images to see the full resolution versions)                  The design goal is to give this community a distinct look and feel, while still looking like a part of the Stack Exchange network. So I'm not making any layout changes.    The design should also reflect the Android branding. After looking at numerous Android related sites and UI patterns, I've become a big fan of its simplistic and elegant designs.    For the overall look and feel, I want to keep the site airy and clean. The faint honeycomb pattern in the background provides a pleasant noise, but does not get in the way of the content. I also think "Honeycomb" is an appropriate pattern to use because of the Android tablet name.    For the most of the site elements, I went for a "flat" look, polished by hints of translucency. The 3D effects are only reserved for action items such as buttons and widgets.    Of course I'm also using the established green (#A4C639) from the Android branding.     For the typeface, I'm using  Droid Sans .    Please let me know what you think. Assuming there are no major design changes, the site will launch very soon.

 A lot of folks are using the  tmobile-g1  tag to refer to the "HTC G1" ... presumably because the phone has no HTC branding on it and the tag exists so it seems reasonable (that's why I used it ...) Seems like both  tmobile-g1  and  htc-dream  should be merged under a single tag that follows the " manufacturer-model " format.      I don't have the reputation to suggest tag synonyms but this seems worth addressing?        Users with more than 1250 reputation and a total answer score of 5 or more on the tag, can suggest tag synonyms. Users with a total answer score of 5 or more, can vote for tag synonyms. Suggestions will be automatically approved when they reach a score of 4, and automatically deleted when they reach a score of -2.       I propose perhaps a community wiki here on meta to tease out all the poorly formed device tags and identify the correct tag they belong under.     Perhaps along the way we can do more re-tagging of posts with  inappropriate device tags  so that  new users  don't look around, see a lot of bad behavior and model their own posts after folks who are doing it wrong!

 I've seen a lot of questions with good solid answers that have been upvoted repeatedly (even questions where the asker has commented on an answer and basically said that it helped them solve their problem) but the asker never officially marks any answer as the one that helped them.

Also as a personal curiosity, I was awarded a bounty yesterday but when you look at  the question  it doesn't appear to have been marked as having an answer.

 There are a handful of posts tagged with  iphone ,  iphone-4 ,  ios ,  ios4 .    Often the question is OS specific -- how do I migrate my contacts  to  or  from  an iPhone -- or at least isn't about doing something with the iPhone device other than running the iOS on it.

 I have several small-ish questions about the viability of rooting a Nook Color for use as a general purpose tablet. I am considering getting one, and these are technical questions about the root process and operation of the NC that I'd like to find answers for before I make a decision. They are not "should I buy one" questions so I think they definitely fall outside the scope of a shopping recommendation. It's more research than anything else.    Would it be best to post them in one bullet-pointed question, or break them up? They're all pretty narrow in scope, so I'm a little on the fence. I found  this related question  on Meta SO, but I'm still not quite sure if it would make sense to have about 5 one- or two-line questions instead of one that's roughly half a page or so.

 So we've currently got tags for  Windows ,  Windows XP ,  Mac ,  OSX ,  Linux   &amp;  Ubuntu .    That looks like three too many to me.    I don't see why as an Android site we'd care about the difference between WinXP and the rest of the desktop Windows family in a way that needs separate tags (we do have a Windows-Mobile tag as well, but as a mobile device OS that is a a special case, so I've left it out), similarly I don't see why we'd care about differences between Ubuntu and Linux in general. As for "Mac" and "OSX" they're essentially synonyms in common usage, I'd propose combining them into a "Mac-OSX" tag to make it easier to find.        Update  have proposed some of these as synonyms (ubuntu as a synonym for linux and windows-xp as a synonym for windows), vote here:  https://android.stackexchange.com/tags/synonyms?filter=suggested&amp;tab=newest     I'd suggest that "mac" and "osx" need merging and renaming to "mac-osx" but I don't have the necessary mod powers for that, could someone else help here, please.

 I've been looking at a lot of the device tags, and creating wikis for many of them. I tend to point to Wikipedia for phone specs because it's pretty comprehensive. The  HTC Desire  page was somewhat confusing and I was curious about whether there are any synonyms floating around, so I  looked it up on Wikipedia .     The text is pretty much a direct quote.

 I realize (now) that the site design was a community process, and this feedback may not be desired or appropriate, but, well, here it is.  Vote to close if and as necessary...    I find myself not participating in Android Enthusiasts simply because of the new theme.  It's been a couple of weeks now and instead of going away my feeling are intensifying.  I almost don't know how to put what I don't like about the design into words, but I realize I have to at least try.  The whole design is too...light?  Bright?  Monotonous/monolithic?  All of which combines to create an almost literal blur.  The beta design had non-subtle (but still non-obtrusive) color, the questions were easily distinguishable, questions with tags I like were well-highlighted.  Different elements had texture or edges or were otherwise easily distinguishable from the background.  The new theme is just too...subtle?  All-encompassing?  Overwhelming?    I open the site each day (via the Firefox Morning Coffee extension), and have participated daily since I joined 6 months ago.  The last two weeks...more often than not, I simply close the window.  I hope I'm the only one feeling this, but in case I'm not, I felt I should post it.    I know how much work a cohesive site design involves, and I in no way wish to denigrate the work that went into this site design.  Tastes and styles are highly subjective things, and I don't expect to be liking everything I see on this great net of ours.  The result of this design though is almost physically pushing me away and I just wanted to give feedback in case others were feeling anything similar.    Thanks for listening!

 When I view  this answer , the upvote and downvote buttons are not highlighted, which seems to indicate that I have not voted on it.

 It could just be me, but one thing that's happened since the new design has been launched is that, more than once I've typed out an answer to a question, and then once I've read through it to double-check there's no glaring errors, I go to post the answer, but stop because the button is disabled. I then go through a bit of a rigmarole of searching round the page to see if I've missed ticking any boxes, adding any tags, etc, then copying all the text to clipboard/notepad and then reloading the page to make sure the question hasn't been deleted/closed/migrated, then finally try clicking the button to see what the error message will be - only for everything to post correctly with no problem.    I think this is because, to me at least, the "Post Your Answer"/"Post Your Question" buttons look exactly like disabled "greyed-out" buttons in Windows (and in many web apps), to the extent that I seem to be mentally conditioned to not even consider clicking them until I've looked all round the form to see what I've missed.          As an example from a popular web app many of us will be familiar with, here an enabled and disabled button in Gmail, notice which one the Post button on here looks like:         Is there a way that the various post buttons can be made to look a bit more "active" perhaps a bit of colour, or something along those lines?

 I marked  this question  as off-topic and was overridden by Al as indicated in the comments.    I'm not questioning his decision as a mod at all (Al and I are totally cool!  I swear! lol :-D), but I think the FAQ could use a bit of clarification when it comes to off-topic posts.  As it stands it's actually pretty vague as far as providing examples:            every answer is equally valid:    “What’s your favorite ______?”     your answer is provided along with the    question, and you expect more answers: “I use ______ for ______, what do you use?”     there is no actual problem to be solved: “I’m curious if    other   people feel like I do.”     we are being asked an open-ended,    hypothetical question: “What if ______ happened?”     it is a rant disguised as a question: “______ sucks, am I right?”          Actually, now that I'm rereading the FAQ it seems like this is the generic FAQ that every SE site gets during beta.

Changing the user agent is valid but maybe not the only answer to my question.   Because I didn't know that changing user agent can force load the desktop version I wasn't able to find the answer.

 I noticed today that we have an  information  tag. It seems like it started out benignly, and it has been used for questions about getting system info from the phone or where your personal information is stored. However, I noticed it because  this question  was tagged with  information , seemingly because they were looking for information about a specific topic.    I personally think it's kind of a vague tag, and would be prone to further misuse (like above). My initial thought was to possibly create instead a  system-info  tag and a  personal-info  tag (or similar) since I think they would be much less likely to be used in unintended ways.

 This question is directly related to my answer to a question on the main site:  Mobile to PC skype video chat?     The timeline for the sake of relevancy: The questioner was looking for a way to make a Skype video call from his phone (EVO, not supported by Skype's video feature) to a computer. I saw a thread on XDA which was discussing the idea with the rather vague title of "Skype with Video", and I left a comment containing a link to that thread. As it turns out, there is a Skype .apk in that XDA thread which has been modified to allow video calls on unsupported phones. The link to said .apk has been subsequently  edited into my answer .    My concern: In the United States, the modified .apk is almost certainly a copyright violation under DMCA law. It may also fall under international laws, but I'm not really sure (I also will not comment on other countries as I am not familiar enough with their laws). Being that both Skype and Stack Exchange are based in the US, I'm not sure that international law would really fall into play anyhow.    The edit which includes the link was added, then rolled back (by Al Everett), then added again. Since there seems to be something of a gray area here, I wanted to explicitly pose this question: Where do we stand on modified .apk files? For that matter, does anyone know where the  law  stands on these files? Patching the file presumably required decompilation of the .apk, which is why I believe it would constitute a copyright violation in countries with DMCA-like laws.

 I've been trying to figure out if a particular question I have is on topic, and haven't been able to find much in the way of guidance. I found the question,  Should the FAQ section on off-topic questions be clarified? , but that didn't seem to provoke much of a response.    I realize that the particular section being referred to in the above question is not editable, however, most sites,  especially  sites that are out of beta, have added this information by now.  See for example:       Programmers FAQ     Seasoned Advice FAQ     Mathematics FAQ     Gaming FAQ     English FAQ       I posed this question in chat and someone implied that it is somehow self-explanatory. I really don't think that it is. For example, which of the following are on topic, and what, if any, are the restrictions on them?      App recommendations (what's a good X app)?   App comparisons (which is a better X app, Y or Z)?   Carrier/network concerns - (is phone X compatible with carrier Y)?   General network questions (what's the difference between 3G and 4G)?   General device questions (what's a Candy Bar form factor)?   Extremely basic questions (how do I use the alarm clock)?   Obscure tech support questions (error X in app-that-nobody's-heard-of Y)?   Tactics for Android games (which may or may not be unique to Android)?      That's just off the top of my head. If they're  all  on topic, then that's great - please mention this on the  on-topic  section. If  any  of them are off-topic then it would really help to have a supplementary off-topic section in the FAQ, as many other sites do.    P.S. I also found the entries in  FAQ: "What kind of questions should I NOT ask here?"  to be of no help at all. Shopping recommendations, duplicate questions, and speculation questions are all already covered by the boilerplate FAQ and aren't on topic anywhere in the network.

 When I go to  the privileges page , "remove new user restrictions" in the list on the right side overflows into the percentage column, forcing a wrap.  This in in Chrome 13.

 I was just editing  https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/4060/what-blogs-write-about-good-android-apps-and-tips  when I realized we might have something of a problem.  I moved the answer-in-the-question out to a proper answer, and added my own answer; now there are 7 answers.  If we split all the other answers into one website per answer we'll have 14 answers, which is getting unwieldy.    On the one hand I would prefer one site per answer so that we can vote on them individually and the good ones can rise to the top.  This also makes sense since it's impossible to create a single definitive answer (some editors will find a particular site useful and others won't).  Once the answers overflow a page, though, you get into a situation where new answers never get seen or voted on, since few people go to the next page.    What should we do about this?

  Update x2:  See  the official contest meta post .     Update:   This contest will now be taking place next week (10.17-10.21). Also, instead of leaving an Answer, contestants will only have to gain 5 points across the Android site during the contest period to increase their chances of winning  3x . Eligible participants will be calculated on the back-end by the Community &amp; CHAOS teams and a winner will be randomly generated and announced at the end of the contest period. Stay tuned for the official contest post, published Monday.     .....    We have a Galaxy SII to giveaway via Twitter tomorrow (Wednesday 10/12). RT a message announced tomorrow morning, and your name will be entered into a random drawing.     This is an outreach initiative, and the main purpose is to use this goodie to spread the word on Android.SE. But I want to make sure that established Stack Exchange users have a leg up on the competition here. Also, I want to try something new.    With that in mind, I've proposed contestants can double (or triple - I'm undecided here) their chances by leaving an "Answer" in the official contest meta post. Leaving an answer in meta requires 5 rep points.    In a brief chat yesterday, @MatthewRead cleared using a meta Answer as contest platform in this instance. Depending on how it turns out, this may be a one and done contest model.    Any thoughts? Should an answer 2x or 3x a participant's chances? We want established users to be rewarded. Also, we want newbies to participate on the site (but not perversely). Yet we don't want to strongly discourage RT-ing the tweet as making this a Twitter contest was a precondition to receiving the phone.    Lemme know your thoughts!

 I'm considering buying a Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9, with the main use as a portable "table phone". It has GSM phone functionality built-in, but  not enabled out of the box. I'm very distrustful of devices where you need to activate such a key functionality using third party software - it makes me suspect it is not going to work 100% reliably.

 The  applications  tag is only supposed to be used for questions that are about Android applications in general. Unfortunately, that hasn't always happened.    Here are a few of the misuses:      the  development  tag tells people not to use it, so they use "applications" instead   the question is about a single application, which may or may not have its own tag already   none of the tags the asker wants exists, or they don't really want to add any, and it's almost always listed as a tag suggestion, so they add it because they're forced to add a tag   there has been a question or two that use  other  definitions of "application", mainly "an act of putting to use"      Not to mention the "application recommendation" questions we're really prefer not to have.    There are  a lot  of questions in this tag, and I'd estimate at least a third of these (if not more) are misuses of the tag.    So, if you're of a mind to help with some housecleaning, please do so. Don't worry if you don't have sufficient privs. Editing suggestions are very helpful too. (Moderators can't be everywhere at once, you know. Plus you can get free reputation points.)

 Perhaps I'm splitting hairs a bit here, but I noticed just now that  nookcolor  is a synonym of  nook . While on the one hand I can understand why this was probably done, part of me feels like this is, in essence, not correct. For one, they are not the same device, so it seems kind of unintuitive that they are pointing to each other like this. Secondly, it is  entirely possible to root a "Nook Classic"  and the rooting method is different than  that of the Nook Color . Clearly there is potential for relevant rooting questions on each, if nothing else, though I can certainly imagine other questions for each being very different as well.    So, should this synonym really exist? Even if there are no valid  nook  questions at the moment, I feel like they should be separate tags.   Should "nookcolor" really be a synonym of "nook"? discussion  status-completed  synonym-request

 Case in point, this recent question  https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/47582/published-android-app-on-playstore-and-my-email-is-now-disclosed-to-scrappers     This question was closed by eldarerathis, in accordance to ASE's scope as defined in the faq, however I don't believe it should.

 I am the author of an as-yet-unresolved question,  How can I prevent applications from running on startup?  that has now become part of the  Kindle Fire Contest .    I'll admit straight up - I'm not very active on this site. So I was a bit surprised when I saw 3 new answers to that question. I was even a little excited - for a very brief moment, until I actually  read  them.    My question was hardly complicated or unclear; its only notable characteristics were:       No mention of the underlying motivation (which was intentional, as there might be many different reasons to want to prevent auto-start); and     A request for solutions  other  than task-killers.       So it was rather annoying and depressing to find that  all 3 new answers seemed to blatantly ignore or misrepresent the content of the question . Each new answer very pointedly (a) explicitly assumes that I am worrying about RAM and (b) leaves the advice  not to kill tasks to save memory . Thanks for nothing, guys. I understand that maybe there is no good answer (with mobile devices, we're used to it) and would certainly upvote/accept a well-substantiated answer explaining why it can't be done, but I didn't even get  that .    Afterward, I noticed the  kindle-fire-contest  tag on my question and read about the contest, and quickly realized why I was receiving these duplicated, half-assed cookie-cutter answers. To that point, I have some concerns about the way this contest is structured; what I definitely  don't  want (for me, or for this site) is a bunch of low-quality non-answers posted by people who just registered for the contest and don't really understand our philosophy or expectations here on Stack Exchange - in particular, the expectation to   answer the question  .    So to get to my point, and I apologize for the long-winded nature of this post:   I don't think that this contest should be open to anyone and everyone . That turns this contest into more of a sweepstakes where people are encouraged to shoot from the hip. A major contest like this should be rewarding  active  contributors, not bounty hunters. In other words,  it should have been/should be limited to users with at least some history of participation on the site , probably in the form of minimum reputation.    No entry requirement encourages people to answer  only  the contest questions (often sloppily), and quite possibly fade back into obscurity after the contest is done. A minimum rep requirement would force new or casual users (like me) to contribute  properly  for at least a few days in order to be eligible, increasing the chance of retention and benefiting the site more even if they don't stick around.    I would propose a minimum 200-rep eligibility criteria and a 2-3 week contest duration instead of 1 week. That would give people who are truly worthy of the prize plenty of time to  make  themselves eligible if they aren't already. If 200 rep, which is just  20  upvotes (10 for associated accounts) seems like too much effort for them, then there's no  way  we want to reward them for their apathy.    Any thoughts? Do others agree that the incentive structure here is a bit unbalanced? Would a minimum reputation help or are there better ways to control for the unintended consequences?   Should the Kindle Fire contest be a little more restrictive? discussion  site-promotion

 I always find it irritating that questions marked as duplicate show up as closed in the overview. Of course these questions are closed, but they are not closed because they are off-topic or because they have a poor quality. That's why they should be distinguishable from other closed questions by displaying [duplicate].    I'd like to point out the good arguments from Kate Gregory        But when you look at a lower-volume site with a lot of closing (eg   programmers.se) the [closed] markers are telling what's welcome here   and what's not. When things are closed as dupes they look unwelcome,   which they're not. I think the "first impression" is better when dupes   are marked as such.

 We did something similar on  Philosophy , where we designate one philosopher each week, and each person who asks a question relating to that philosopher will be eligible to win a prize. It's gotten a positive response so far, and we could easily adapt the model for this site - that is, designate a topic each week, and everyone who asks a question about it that week is entered into a drawing to win prizes.     We could start with questions about the new operating system, Ice Cream Sandwich, then move on app week, tablet week, etc.     What do you think?

 This week, we’re kicking off a “Topic of the Week” series.    How it works: We will designate one topic each week, and each person who asks a question relating to that topic will be eligible to win a prize.    How to enter:  Ask a question  relating to the topic of the week, and tag it accordingly (this week, use the "4.0-ice-cream-sandwich" tag - see example questions  here ). Each question you ask will get you one entry into a random drawing to win an Android accessory of your choice (under $50). Or $50 worth of ice cream sandwiches.     Choosing the topic of the week: For this first week, we decided to go with the newest Android operating system, Ice Cream Sandwich (see the discussion  here ). But for all following weeks we want to take suggestions from you!

 ...because that's what they are.    Granted, there's not a "store" but it's the same idea as "where can I get the cheapest Android phone".     If nothing else, it's someone trying to crowdsource their web search.    That said, a canonical "where can I find Android ROMs" question (Community Wiki) would be a good idea. 1         1  I don't flash ROMs to my Android devices, so I wouldn't be a good person to do that.

 Earlier this week, we kicked off a "Topic of the Week" series, and this week is tablet week!    How it works: Each person who asks a question about an Android tablet will be entered into a drawing to win a prize.    How to enter: Ask a question about any Android tablet and tag it  tablet  (along with any other appropriate tags - feel free to use a tag for the specific tablet as long as you also use the "tablet" tag). Each question you ask will get you one entry into a random drawing to win Android accessories (your choice up to $100).     Dates: Tablet week begins now and will end Monday January 2nd at 10 am EST. We are announcing this contest a few days early because of the holidays this weekend.      Edit : Tablet week is now over. Congratulations to Padma Kumar for winning!

 I just tried to join this forum while using Chrome, my default browser for now.  I've gone through my settings and there is nothing blocking cookie usage.  I've been logging in to other SE sites with no trouble, including a few within the last 30 minutes or so.    But when I tried logging on to here for the first time, using OpenID, first I got a page saying, "This account is detected in 8 other StackExchange sites.  Use this information?" when I clicked the "Create account" button, I got a one line text only message on an otherwise blank page telling me to enable cookies.    I got this several times and each time checked my preferences, but they're set to allow cookies.    So I tried it with Firefox and it worked -- which is strange, since I have tighter security settings on Firefox than on Chrome.    Once I closed Firefox and then clicked "log in" (at the top of any page here), I had no problem with my account being recognized.

  Edit:  The changes have been implemented. Individual device rooting questions are encouraged, though we want answers to be complete -- covering all Android versions.  The big rooting question now indexes the individual questions.        Recently in chat  it was mentioned that our Community Wiki question,  How do I root my Android device? , doesn't quite work.  I had been thinking this myself recently and I think it's time we brought it up here on Meta.    The crux of the matter seems to be two points:      Forum posts are incomplete, badly written, and sometimes  just plain wrong .  We can do better than just link to them.   Rooting methods often vary from version to version.  At minimum, we need more than one entry for many of the devices and a way to classify them.      Solving these problems via the current post would require adding a   lot   more information to the post.  Even if we didn't include our own rooting guide, we'd still need to add versions numbers, explanations, and so on.  The post would become massive.    Given this,  I think it's best that we create one post per device .  These questions should each have one answer with a complete rooting guide that addresses all software versions, referencing forum posts if applicable but not relying on their existence or quality.  We can create posts for highly-anticipated devices on release (to grab the traffic) and wait for questions to actually be asked about others, to avoid cluttering the site with every guide on the planet.    The current question could continue in its current form, changing the index to link to our questions instead of externally.  The general tips and list of rooting tools that work on many devices is certainly useful.    Side benefits include searchability (the question "How do I root my device?" is less likely to match the search "How can I root my Kindle Fire?" than a question titled the same as the search) and hopefully drawing some (constructive) users here from XDA and the other forums.    Should we do this?   Should we revisit our "How do I root X?" policy? discussion  status-completed  site-promotion  community-wiki

 I'm talking about  this  question where the OP has asked question about developer account.    The question was migrated here from Stackoverflow. Then it got closed being off topic in context of Android Enthusiasts.    Shouldn't the question have been migrated back to Stackoverflow? Or is it technically not possible?

 Today I saw this banner on StackOverflow         I had to make a huge mental effort just to get that the gray portal that holds the question text is in fact an Android device. The reason is it has proportions of an iPad-like tab - - very close to a square - but most Android devices are smartphones and smartphones have slightly different proportions - less square. Also the gray portal completely lacks Android-specific hardware buttons that make Android devices distinguishable from say mobile Windows devices (the latter have different buttons).    IMO the banner needs improvements. My suggestions would be the following (I myself lack drawing capabilities):      make the thing more elongated (less square) - something like HTC Incredible S proportions   add margins on the "top" and the "bottom" (if held in portrait orientation) as real smartphones usually have   add hardware buttons   change orientation to landscape so that there's more room for the text   bring the "Android Enthusiasts" caption out of the device image - place it beneath     "Android device" barely recognizable on banners feature-request  status-bydesign  site-promotion  design 
 I already knew we had an  android-source  tag, but apparently we also have an  aosp  tag (with AOSP being an acronym for Android Open Source Project, for anyone who might not be aware). This strikes me as kind of redundant, especially since the tag wiki for  android-source  explicitly uses the acronym "AOSP".    It seems to me that the  android-source  could actually be removed, since it largely serves as a tag for off-topic development questions (it seemed to crop up mostly after "android" was blacklisted). There are a couple of questions that actually do ask about Android's source code, but I don't see any reason why those few couldn't be retagged to use  aosp  (still a perfectly valid tag for those questions, I think), and then the tags could be synonymized somehow or  android-source  could just be abandoned.    To expand a bit on what motivated this discussion/question: I've always thought  android-source  was just not a very useful tag. It  could  have potential use, I suppose, but most of the legitimate uses (in my opinion) would overlap with  aosp . Discussion of Android's source code in a general sense feels out-of-scope for us, and so I'm not personally convinced that  android-source  really has a compelling use case from that angle.

 Title basically says it.  google-chrome-to-phone  and  chrome-to-phone  should probably be synonymized somehow.

 If I was to ask about finding the right charger for my device, would that be off-topic?    The help center  says :        The following topics are expressly   off-topic   here:    ...

It seems to me like this could be construed as a shopping question. On the other hand, it also feels like a " problem  (with [my] Android device) [that I am] trying to solve" and the community here would probably be able to help with it. I'm also thinking it would probably not be so narrow that it would never help anyone else in the future, like shopping questions often are.    Would this question be off-topic? Thanks!

 I'm wondering how much this site is really active.    Of 5 questions I asked, 3 received no answer at all. That's a pretty high number, I've never encountered anything like that on any SE site so far.    Sure, it might be just chance, but still I think it was worth to ask here.

 Ok, so I was going to start editing a couple of questions and answers to clean up the formatting and make them a bit more readable, but thought I'd check in here first. Is there a preferred way to indicate a screen item?    For example, if I'd instruct someone on how to check the phone OS version, I'd use inline code ( Settings -&gt; About phone -&gt; Android version  or  Settings  ->  About phone  ->  Android version ) to separate the clickable items from body text.    Another option would be to use the kbd tag ( Settings -> About phone -> Android version ), but in my opinion this seems a bit bulky.    It would be nice to have a standard way to format these things.

  This contest has ended.  There was a separate prize pool for Android Guys users. The winner from that pool is dev0, for  this question . The winner from the broader community is ProjectJourneyman, for  this question . Congratulations!    If anyone is interested in the contest details, see below.       Audio Week is a larger version of the  Weekly Topic Challenges , with slightly different rules and even better prizes.    To enter, ask questions related to the audio output of an Android device. Anything tagged  audio  is eligible for this contest, but make sure you add other tags as well (for example, you can also tag the question music if applicable).     Prizes:          The person who asks the most viewed question will receive a Kindle Fire (or another Android tablet of similar value).    The Rules      The contest is open to both new and current Stack Exchange and android.stackexchange.com  users.   Everyone is eligible to participate regardless of geographic location. If you live in an area of the world where it is too difficult for us to ship you your prize, we’ll figure something else out on a case by case basis.   The only metrics we’re using to determine winners are the number of page views your questions get. So ask as many good questions as you can, and share them using whatever means you see fit. Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Google Plus, whatever!   There will be separate (and equal!) prizes for Android Guys readers who are participating in this contest. Check out  this post on Android Guys  for more details. Remember, if you heard about us from our friends at Android Guys, make sure to say in your profile "I am an Android Guys reader."      Dates: The contest begins Monday, February 6th at 12:01 am and goes until Friday, February 17th at 11:59 pm (UTC).

 Allow me to preface this with a bit of a disclaimer. I do not want to sound ungrateful or upset with the efforts of the SE team to support and promote this site. I think it's  fantastic  that SE is willing to create little contests and promotions and such for its sites, and I'm genuinely appreciative of the support they provide to all of the sites in the network. I very much enjoy Android Enthusiasts, and I don't see that changing any time soon.    Now, having said that, I feel the need to voice a bit of concern over the specifics of some of our site promotions. This was motivated initially by what I felt was an almost immediate flood of low-quality questions in  audio  for the current contest, so I decided to go back and do a little bit of datamining on the previous ones. What concerns me is that although we may be getting attention from the contests, we are:      Generally not retaining the users we attract   Causing a larger-than-usual influx of poor questions   (In my view) Run the risk of possibly disillusioning some of the more regular and loyal members      Now that we've had a few goes at some contests, I think we can start to analyze the results a bit. I'm going to go through the past contests in what should essentially be chronological order with a bit of data I collected by simply scanning the relevant tags and user profiles:     Kindle Fire Contest     This contest in some ways worked and in some ways felt like it kind of didn't. On the one hand, it brought attention to a lot of older unanswered questions, which is generally great. On the other hand, one user was so annoyed by what he perceived to be a flood of non-answers grabbing for loot, that he actually  removed the tag from his own question so that it would not be part of the contest . There were certainly lots of cases of non-answers or half-answers attempting to get in on the contest, which provided a lot of clutter that people ended up needing to downvote since the rules dictated that anything with a score of  zero  was an eligible entry. In my opinion, this doesn't really encourage quality participation, but that's probably neither here nor there.    The winners of the contest also show some concerning stats. Of the 5 winners:      2 have not visited the site since the end of the contest   1 has visited but has made no other contributions to the site     Additionally, this user has only one post total (mind you, this is  the post which won the contest for them ) and it currently sits at  a net score of -1  (!!)          Ice Cream Sandwich week     ICS week was the first tag-themed week. It was presented to the community on Meta before starting and received generally positive responses. Overall the week played out relatively well, but still seemed to encourage one-off posts to win sweet loot:      18 questions asked   1 of the 18 was closed   5 of the users (I count 14 total unique users, so ~35%) have no other activity on their profiles whatsoever   The winning question ultimately had the  4.0-ice-cream-sandwich  removed (!!) - It was quite arguably never about ICS to begin with.       Tablet week     Tablet week started immediately after ICS week, and was not presented to the userbase as a whole beforehand. It was also not one of the tags suggested in the ICS week's answers. I found this to be a bit unusual as  tablet  is a pretty broad tag, but it didn't seem like an unreasonable choice. This perhaps lent to the fact that there were very few entries (it's a bit of a low-traffic tag).      6 questions were asked (none closed)   1 user has no other posts on the site       Apps week     I have to be blunt here: this was a terrible tag choice, in my opinion.  applications  is absolutely notorious for being a dumping ground for questions where the author can't come up with any other relevant tags. It's vague, it's broad, and it attracts junk and (I think) should be actively discouraged whenever possible. I firmly believe that if this tag had been pitched to the community via Meta it would have been met with substantial resistance. The stats for this week were:      18 questions asked   3 closed   7 users (out of 17) have no other activity outside of the contest or the contest timeframe       Audio week     Similar to tablet week, this seems like an unusual tag choice to me. It is very broad, and it is also fairly low traffic (111 posts as of this writing, which includes the sudden influx of contest questions). Additionally, this week is based purely on views, which seems to further fly in the face of promoting high-quality contributions. Realistically, a winning entry needs only to be  acceptable  with effective link distribution. Audio week has also not fared so well, in my opinion, as it currently has:      13 questions asked   5 of the 13 (this is ~38%) have been closed, one has 3 close votes   7 of the users have (so far) no other activity on the site      I don't claim to have any solutions, but I do think that perhaps we should at least discuss the contests that have been run so far. As a community, I'm curious to know:      How do we feel about these contests and this data? Are we concerned? Do we consider these contests successful?   What other contest styles could we look at? Are there other options?   Should we be concerned about the fact that established, loyal users have no benefit over one-off throwaway accounts in these contests (which, in many cases appear to never return)?   Should the eligible posts be moderated more stringently or held to a higher standard than simply "Not a negative score and not closed"? Are view-based contests a good idea?     Do we need to rethink our site promotions and contests? discussion  site-promotion

 I wanted to reward a bounty for this  answer . Intent was to reward 50 of my rep, but the minimum I could reward was 100 (it's a first time bounty on that question, so  subsequent bounty  clause doesn't apply)    Little research showed the reason-  because I had also  answered  there (for questions I had not answered, I can award 50 as minimum, just as I can do for my own questions)     That is fine by me and I went ahead and placed 100 bounty as that particular answer was very useful to me     Questions        I do not see any documentation on the site  or on meta saying  , saying " if you want to award a bounty to an answer, where you have also answered, the minimum bounty is 100  "      What is the  logic  behind this?

 I noticed that  vanilla  exists currently as a synonym of  stock-android . I know there was a request to merge these tags previously:  Merge stock, stock-android, vanilla; define &quot;stock-android&quot;     I'm curious, though, if this is actually correct or if it's confusing.  Lie Ryan's answer  to that request sums up my personal understanding of "stock" vs "vanilla" rather well:        I think a better definition for "stock" is a   manufacturer/carrier-blessed ROMs for a particular device, including   upgrades. I prefer to define it this way because some people may not   realize that they have an upgraded ROM due to automatic OTA upgrades.        And "vanilla" are ROM which attempts to be as close as possible to   original AOSP ROMs (e.g. by removing carrier/manufacturer   customization and adding none of their own customization). A vanilla   ROM may or may not be produced by a third-party.        In particular, only "Pure Google Experience" phones (e.g. G1, Nexus   One, Nexus S), had a ROM that is both stock (comes with the device)   and vanilla (no manufacturer/carrier customization).      Now the above has always been my understanding, too, with "stock" referring to "the ROM your device was  stocked  with" (i.e. off the shelf). However, the tag wiki itself for  stock-android  seems to be unable to decide what "stock" is either. The summary states:        Broadly, the Android OS that shipped with your device or as updated by   your carrier or the manufacturer.      ...but then the extended tag wiki says:        This is in contrast to devices with custom operating systems or   after-market applications that dramatically change the user interface.      This seems entirely contradictory, since in many cases the OS that ships with your device  does  dramatically change the user interface.    Can we please find some consistency here? I've personally never attributed "stock" to mean unomodified Android from source so I'm not entirely sure where it got conflated with that definition, but either way this is currently just...confusing.   Let's revisit the "stock" vs. "vanilla" tagging, shall we? discussion  tags

  Greetings, Androids! I am a moderator over on Super User, and we're talking about  adding Android Enthusiasts to our default migration paths  (available to 3K+ users). Right now, when there's an Android question on Super User, it can only be migrated manually by a moderator.     Migration statistics on SU show that Android is the 4th most common migration target from Super User. We hardly ever migrate to Gaming, which is currently occupying the last slot in our default migration options. We would like to replace that with Android, since it would allow our high-rep users to migrate questions here without needing moderator intervention. This would increase the number of android-related questions which get actual answers instead of just being closed, and lower the burden on us moderators.    Before making the switch, we'd like to make sure that's OK with the moderators and users over here. Have you seen any problems with incoming android-related questions from Super User? Are there any reservations about opening this up as a migration path?    We have pretty unanimous agreement among SU users to go ahead and implement this, but thought we should double check with you first, just to make sure. If everybody on this side is down with it, we'll go ahead and switch it out!    Thanks! &mdash; nhinkle♦, SU moderator   Super User is planning to add Android to our migration paths: any feedback? discussion  migration  close-reasons 
 Currently, there are  960   questions with no upvoted answers  on the main site. Of those:      around  800  are more than a month old.    710  have no answer at all.   more than  400  questions are of score 0 or less.      Additionally, Android-SE has a  85%  answer rate which puts us squarely in the lowest percentile (around 70th place out of 84).    I hope I'm not alone thinking that something needs to be done to improve the situation. What other sites are doing:       The guys over at TeX-SE hold regular  "Answer the Unanswered"  sessions that are quite structured and efficient. Questions are answered, deleted, merged etc. as necessary. The site manages to keep the unanswered volume around 200 regardless of the growth TeX-SE has experienced recently. I'd venture that something like 30-50 questions are dealt with in every session. See the  chat session  to get an idea how it works.     We do something similar on  Travel-SE  -- there is a somewhat irregular  "Answer-a-thon"  sessions that are scheduled a week or so in advance in chat.        I think we can do something similar on our own, depending on high-rep users and mods time constraints. I'd say a whole-day, drop-in session, held once per month in the weekend. I think we should be focusing most on the following:      Closing old unanswered questions with weird device issues. Set some limit of say 2 months since last user intervention on the question. Decrease this for low-rep users that haven't visited the site for a long period -- say a month or so, or have only this one question. Reason for close would be most often "too localized".   Finding duplicates, or creating artificially ones -- for example, hunting down OS upgrade information for devices we don't currently list in the "When will my device receive the X upgrade".

 I think the  contacts  tag should have a synonym of "people" as the new contact/people manager in android 4.0 is now called people.    I also noticed that we have a tag  xyboard . This should probably be changed to motorola-xyboard, or maybe even motorola-droid-xyboard to follow the same naming as the other device tags.   Can these tags be created/merged/synonym-ed? discussion  synonym-request 
 Could someone please clarify when a post should include the Android version, and when they should not?    This question stems  from a retag  on a question I  recently posted . The workaround/solution that I found was buried in the OS of the phone, hence it seems appropriate that it should have been tagged 2.3 Gingerbread. I'm not worried about qualifying for the contest (clicking the buttons and throwing pizels is good enough a prize for me), I'm just looking for when and why to tag as 2.3.    As far as I can tell, the question is describing a problem that stems possibly from the OS, the hardware (in perfect condition), the hardware (after long use), and subsequent software installed. The tag was also describing the type of problem (power, as best I could describe, though display may also fit).       What is the policy for tagging with the OS?    How can I tell when tagging with the OS is extraneous or meta-tagging?     Retag Clarification: Tagging of Distribution Code Names discussion  support 
 The user that made me want to do this is the new, 1 rep user  https://android.stackexchange.com/users/13173/  ( warning  username NSFW, website link NSFW)     Or is just a case of flagging their post and making a mention of it on Meta?

 Ignoring for the moment that "Google Play" is a stupid name, how should we tag it?    Obviously we need to have  google-play  as a synonym of  market  (which I have done), but should the new name be the master?  We should probably also take a look at questions tagged the latter than aren't about the Android Market specifically, since the tag may have been seen as generic unlike its other synonym  android-market .   How should we tag Google Play? discussion  tags 
 Lately I feel as though there's been something of an upswing in questions which I've personally come to call "Help me find a website for X" questions. Some recent examples I can think of include:       Performance and used SDHC card for Android phone  (this visible to 10k only)    https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/20347/where-is-the-central-place-having-the-best-chart-for-android-smartphones-on-the     https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/20226/carriers-for-android-where-can-a-ranking-of-smaller-carriers-that-uses-the-netw     https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/19292/where-can-i-find-sacred-odyssey-hd-for-my-android-powered-sony-tablet-s       Generally these get closed, but there are also some older questions which (to me) fit the same formula. One example is  Where can I find a comparison of Android devices?  which is a CW with about 24 upvotes at this point.    I think we should come up with some kind of official stance on questions such as these. My personal opinion is that they should be closed either as "Off-topic" or "Not constructive" because they're simply not good questions, and here's why I think they're bad:      Search engines exist specifically for finding websites. I'd wager 9 times out of 10 the answerers are just going to punch the question into Google and post the first few links.   They're completely vulnerable to linkrot, since most of the time a link is really the only "valid" answer.   They generally have nothing to do with  using  Android or how Android works, just reading about topics that are  related  to Android.   If the content from a decent website were copy/pasted here to avoid linkrot it would become very out-of-date very fast in many cases (it could even feasibly cause copyright infringement concerns).      So my personal opinion is that "Where can I find a website/resource/list for X" questions should be  nuked from orbit . Do others agree? Disagree? Have no opinion whatsoever? It feels like we're going to continue getting questions like this for the forseeable future, so as I said, I think some kind of community stance on this would be highly beneficial. If we deem them inappropriate questions then it gives us something "official" to point people to as well. If not then I'll start leaving them alone.

 This is how questions in the list look on Firefox 7.0 - 10.0:         I'm not sure if that's normal but it looks fine.

 I recently asked a question, and after a couple of days there was no answer, but I really hoped to get help, so I placed a bounty on it.    However, shortly after placing the bounty, I stumbled across what seems to be the solution. I was experimenting in a largely aimless and random fashion, and despite expectations, got a positive result.    I'm waiting a bit to be sure about my solution, but if it turns out that it is in fact the answer to my question, what do I do? I know I can answer and accept my own question, but what about the bounty? Do I and can I award it to myself? Is that cool or is that kind of weird?

 I was performing a quick edit on  this question  and decided to see if we had a  radio  tag available since I know I've seen other questions around about streaming radio stations and such to devices. As it turns out, we do have such a tag, but it's being used to refer to both AM/FM/Internet radio stations and cellular radios. What's the intent of this tag, and how should it be appropriately used? There is currently no tag wiki to indicate the purpose.    My thoughts: Maybe we re-tag the questions about cellular radios with a new tag along the lines of  cellular-radio ? We do have  radio-firmware , but I'm not sure that it's really correct for some of the questions regarding cellular radios (e.g. "How do I disable my 3G radio?" or similar).

 This question is pretty terrible, IMO:         Can I use dual boot in my Android mobile phone?         I want to know is there any boot loader modifying tool for android so that I can use my cell as dual boot. Like Symbian- Android, Android - Windows Mobile, Android - Java, Android - Bada.        Is it possible.      The formatting/wording can be fixed, and it could be made a "How" question about a specific device and OSes (and we have gotten  questions   like that ), but I think it would still be problematic:      I'm not sure we have the relevant expertise.  Getting WP7 (for example) to run on an Android device would require just as much WP7 knowledge as Android knowledge, I would think.   Lie's answer does answer the question, but is it useful?  A specific answer for a specific device would be useful, but most of the time the answer will be "No, no one's figured out how to do this on that phone. As far as I know."      The problem is that I don't really know how to close it, because:      It's a real question. There are valid reasons for wanting to do this.   It's at least partly on-topic.  We deal with Android as hardware, not just the Android OS.  We've had some relatively decent questions about Ubuntu Linux on Android devices.   It's constructive.  Well, the current version of the question isn't, but as noted it could be rewritten.      Given this I've thought up two solutions:      We create a CW question to cover this, the converse of  Can I install Android on my non-Android device?  &mdash; "Can I install a different OS on my Android device?"  Dual booting specifically could be covered in this or possibly another CW question.   We decide that questions about other operating systems are off-topic.

 Can we synonymize  osx  to point to  mac-os-x ? It doesn't make sense to have both, and the latter seems to fit our scheme best.    Also, can we do something with  mac  while we're at it? We have  mac-address  already, so it's also redundant (and confusing) and is also being used in almost every case to refer to the OS rather than a MAC address. I don't know if it should be synonymized or stay around to maybe refer to generic Mac (as in Apple) hardware, but currently it seems confusing. Maybe  macintosh  makes more sense?

 I took a peek at the oldest  Unaswered questions  and most of them are either Too Localized or Not Real Questions (and thus impossible to ever answer) or Shopping Requests (thus not constructive or Off Topic).

Honestly these questions in particular are unaswerable and are clogging up the Unanswered page for miles. Closing them means they don't count as Unanswered (because they can't or shouldn't be answered by us) and means the worst of them (zero/negative voted posts) will eventually be deleted by the system after closure.

 We currently have this line under the off-topic things in the FAQ:            Android-independent phone questions, such as "Does Carrier X have prepaid plans?"          I think that specific example is definitely out of our scope; how you pay for your service isn't a core part of your device or of using it.    On the other hand, we ( myself included ) have been somewhat inconsistent with hardware questions that aren't limited to Android devices.  How your battery capacity affects battery life and similar concerns apply to lots of electronics, but nonetheless can be very important to Android users.    Again I think carrier-related questions and that sort of thing should be continue to be off-topic, we've had that discussion.  But what should we do about these hardware-centric questions?

 Android security, like any computer systems security, is an exact science. If an app has a security issue, that is an objective fact, and someone with appropriate expertise can describe the risks involved with reference to facts about what the app does and how it fits into the workings of Android. So how could a question asking for the facts about what security issues exist in a specific app be too subjective?     I asked a question about what specific security issues exist in a controversial app that had been pulled from the Android market but which some people insist is safe.     Android.stackexchange has a community knowledgable about Android who like answering questions,  app-specific questions  are on topic here,  security  has its own tag, and questions of the form "Is X safe?" are common across the stack exchange family. Since I'm no Android security expert, and since after research, I can only get a very rough and incomplete outline of the facts of the issue, this site seemed the obvious place to ask about what the hard facts were.    I was very surprised to see the question closed for being "subjective".  Here's the question .  (note that I re-wrote it to state and restate explicitly what the focus of the question was. The question itself is the same and you can see the original in edits. I just trimmed background research, context and scene-setting and stated explicitly what kind of facts I was asking for) .     Here's the explanation given for closing:        This question is not a good fit to our Q&amp;A format. We expect answers to generally involve facts, references, or specific expertise; this question will likely solicit opinion, debate, arguments, polling, or extended discussion. See the FAQ for guidance on how to improve it.      How is asking about the facts behind a specific security concern not factual and not involving specific expertise?    I've never seen a question of the form "Is X safe?" closed for being subjective on any stack exchange site, ever. For being poorly written or unclear, sure, but never for being inherently subjective. Here are a few examples of such questions from 5 minutes searching, from stack overflow:  1 ,  2 ,  3  and from serverfault:  1 ,  2 . Many of these are far more subjective than mine, not giving specific reasons for concern and just ask how secure something is in general. They all got good answers that show expertise and reference facts about the product, app or technique in question.    I don't understand why android.stackexchange should be the only site in the stack exchange family where discussing specific security concerns does not "...involve facts, references, or specific expertise" and "will likely solicit opinion, debate, arguments, polling...". Android security is no less of an exact science than security on any other platform.   How are questions about security concerns 'subjective'? discussion  support

 My Idea here is this:    General question are good questions. But sometimes a user asks a narrow question that is really a much broader general question (especially if the user has a specific problem with one app that applies to all apps).    Narrowly asked example:  Force Google Maps to save cached maps on SD card     Generic example: "How can I move parts of an apps internal app data to the SD card"    Issues I have with this specific question here:      The users problem is gone  Both Maps' 6.8.1 and 6.9.0 tiles cache is on SD afaik:  /scard/Android/data/com.android.google.maps/    Some other users might want to know the generic answer to other apps but may not find this question/answer      So: Should one then rewrite the topic or what?

 I noticed that we apparently have a  gmail-synchronization  tag, and I'm considering deleting it and retagging the ~20 questions currently using it. It seems to me that there is no need for this tag as any questions can be adequately covered by simply using  gmail  and  sync  in tandem, rather than creating a compound tag for this, which is something of an anomaly at the moment (i.e. do we create tags like this for every sync-able data feature?).    However, I'm also a little concerned that perhaps there is something unique about the way Gmail syncs it's data which I am perhaps not aware of, so I wanted to pose this question before doing anything. Is there a reasonable use for this tag that I am overlooking, which the other two do not fulfill? Should this tag be kept?

 One of our VTC-reasons reads:        Questions asking us to  find or recommend an app, device, ROM, accessory or off-site resource  are off-topic for Android Enthusiasts as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam and become obsolete quickly.  Instead, describe your situation and the specific problem you're trying to solve.       Due to a  question asking for manuals  (which are not  explicitly  mentioned in this close-reason but most likely  implicated  by the term "off-site resource") I've checked for a corresponding post on Meta which I could refer the OP to to offer some background. Imagine my surprise when I didn't find any! I've checked our  help center  and  FAQ  immediately afterwards, but also nada.    As this is a "custom close reason" of our site, it didn't come "pre-installed" – so somehow it must have gotten there. Unless it came backpack on some malware and now always pops up in that list, we must have done something to bring it in there.    So my two-fold question is:      What resource did I miss here were a community consensus was reached on this?   If that cannot be found, should we now fill this gap to back the reason?      Don't get me wrong: I do   not   want to get rid of that close reason (it's there for a good reason: answers matching this formula tend to outdate quite soon, result in (rotting) link lists, and all the like).    Related Meta posts       Can the FAQ be expanded in terms of what's on topic?     Should the FAQ section on off-topic questions be clarified?

 I flagged  this answer  as not an answer because it doesn't address the question asked. My flag was disputed. A lengthy discussion in the comments has ensued, but the answer is clearly off-topic and should be converted into a comment.    My main concern is that the answer has collected a few upvotes (and my downvote), which puts it near the threshold for a question to be automatically considered answered by the system, even though it is very much not answered. (The other answer might be the solution, but I don't know yet.) I'd hate to see the system gamed, and I don't understand why my original flag would have been disputed in the first place.

 During the last ~10 days, I was walking the list of unanswered questions multiple times (due to ordering issues I wanted to make sure nothing escaped me). While doing this, I stumbled on many questions where the OP obviously just visited once (to ask), and never returned. Sometimes there were comments asking for clarification (mostly unanswered, of course), sometimes not even that.    While things are quite clear if a question is unequivocally off-topic, too localized, etc., some seem quite conforming to the FAQ -- but though very unlikely to be answered, and (IMHO) only of  minor interest ; maybe not "minor enough" to be flagged for  too localized .    So my question here is: what shall be done to those? Sure I could flag everything which is not answered fast enough (&lt;-- exaggerating!), but I don't want to annoy anybody without some backing :)    Or should I rather "relax and wait until some automatism takes care", as suggested  here ?    Another possibility is to collect them here at Meta to bring them up, as e.g. done  here .    Another close question on Meta is  Android-SE Unanswered Questions Cleanup .    And yes, while walking through the list I tried to answer as much as I could (earned 11 Revival badges this way ;) and upvoted the one or other answer to get the list shortened. Still I feel some of the remaining could be "moved out". Ideally we had a separate "Grace tab" for those: questions going in there could stay for a fixed amount of time (say, 4 weeks), and if not answered/voted/... otherwise, would automatically be removed at the end of this "grace time".    Any ideas/recommendations?   What should happen to old unanswered questions where the OP didn't even care to check? discussion

 I personally like questions about data recovery, post mortem analyses and generally pushing some security limits (e.g. to access personal data, crack/circumvent forgotten passphrases, retrieving data from half broken devices and so on). It had many (good!) uses for me and some of my friends in the past.    The general information on how to do X is neutral, however it cannot be guaranteed that it is used with benign intentions only. To boot, all information is freely accessible here too so benign ambitions of the OP or not, there'll be readers that will misuse it eventually.    Should these questions be answered and how?

 Got a bit surprised by finding the  jailbreak , that by definition:        process of removing the limitations imposed by Apple on devices running the iOS operating system through the use of hardware/software exploits...       See the Wikipedia article regarding  jailbreaking      While a jargon expression, it is strictly associated with iOS devices. For Android devices, the jargon is  "Rooting" .    This terms exist and essentially mean the same thing, but each one is specific to a different device type using a different software. At Android Enthusiasts, we deal with only one type, Android, but yet we have three questions sitting on the main site since 2010 tagged  jailbreak :       Is it possible to completely brick your Android phone by using a Custom ROM?

Whether the questions are useful or not, that's another topic, what I'm discussing is:    Is it good to have a tag that's specificity directed to a non-android device?

 (Possibly related to  Upgrade Advice? ; not really I reckon.)

Not looking for a complete list compiled for me, just specific features listed in the question.    My rationale: Because one can't, without rooting the device and doing other things, go back to the Android version one had before the upgrade, I'm not exactly jumping up and down to install the newest version available from the manufacturer.

 Think of a hierachical tag structure/scenario. Currently it's not possible to model an "is a" hierachical relation between tag subclasses and their parents.     A good example are the browsers that are available for Android and the following tags for it:     browser ├── chrome-for-android ├── dolphin-browser ├── firefox ├── opera #virtual, doesn't really exist yet │   ├── opera-mini │   └── opera-mobile └── stock-browser      Currently I need to look for each of the available tags to get all results, i.e. the generic  browser  doesn't list every  browser -relevant questions.    How should this be handled:  Should each subtag also be accompanied by its parent tags? (e.g.  browser, opera, opera-mobile  instead of only  opera-mobile ).     EDIT: I'm not suggesting to add an 'opera-browser' tag here, it's just to take the example to the extremes for better illustration only.   How should hierachical tags be handled? discussion  tags 
 Checking our tags for missing descriptions (tag-wiki), I came across above mentioned tags:       charging  with the synonyms  charger  and  battery-charging     power-management   (no synonym)  with the synonym  battery-manager     power  (no synonym)      Questions tagged  power  are either belonging to  charging  or  power-management . So my suggestion would be to check all questions tagged  power , and re-tag those to  charging  which rather belong there (I volunteer doing this, if the overall task/concept is agreed on) . After that, converting the tag  power  into a synonym to  power-management .

 I recently asked a question about  why I couldn't see error messages logged from K9 using aLogcat  on Jelly bean.    The  only answer  instead answered a different question (i.e. "How do I fix these errors with K9?") so after waiting a while for an update, I flagged it as  not an answer .    My flag was rejected with the reason:  declined - "Not an answer" flags are for posts that are not even attempts to answer.     A moderator then commented:  Perhaps you should have asked that, we generally prefer questions that don't presuppose a solution.     These are not necessarily related, but overall this all seems to be rather poor form to me. I've certainly never seen this sort of reaction on any other stack exchange site I've used regularly. When I ask a question I want an answer to  that question , not the question that someone  thought I should have asked .    I don't blame the answerer for trying, in good faith, to answer the question he may have thought I was asking, but to clarify the question, still not get an answer and then be told by a moderator that I shouldn't have asked that question in the first place is a double blow.    So, should a moderator decline a "not an answer" flag just because they think that you asked the wrong question, even if the answer did not in fact answer your question?    If so, then why has Android Enthusiasts decided to disregard what is considered stack exchange best practice, as detailed in  Flags Too Often Marked [declined] ?

 On  Android Enthusiasts  it states:        The following topics are expressly off-topic here:     Marketing your Android app or doing market research        If in the process of writing an App, assuming no need for help with writing/developing the code, would asking other enthusiasts on  Android Enthusiasts  for feedback regarding the App, and thus trying the App (providing a link to it), be considered as marketing?

 Still going over the tags, I just stumbled upon  angry-birds  (x13) and  angry-birds-space  (x2). I'd suggest to make the spacy chickens a synonym to their earth-bound companions.   Merge the tags "angry-birds" and "angry-birds-space" discussion  status-completed  synonym-request

 Another candidate for merging:  chat-history  is used by only 2 questions (both times together with  google-talk ). Then there's  chat , used 7 times.    Suggestion: Merge  chat-history  into  chat  and either make the former a synonym to the later, or simply drop it. Though in the latter case it might pop-up again if we just wait for the emptied tag to be auto-purged ;)    Same goes for  cloud-storage  (x1), which should be merged into  cloud  (x14 currently).

 Again two synonymous tags:  hotspot  (x11) and  wifi-hotspot  (x37). While it is clear that all wifi-hotspots are hotspots, also all questions tagged "hotspot" relate to Wifi (many of them are even additionally tagged  wifi ). As already said, "hotspot" and "tethering" are different issues ( wifi tags - are wifi-tethering and wifi-hotspot redundant? ), but IMHO this does not apply here.    Suggestion:      merge  hotspot  with  wifi-hotspot    optionally: If someone thinks there are (or could be) non-wifi hotspots, add the  wifi  tag to the merged items from "wifi-hotspot"   make "wifi-hotspot" a synonym to "hotspot"     Merge wifi-hotspot and hotspot tags discussion  status-completed  synonym-request 
 While the tag wiki states the  Motorola Droid  is exclusively offered by Verizon, it is almost identical to the  Motorola Milestone  (see  Wikipedia ). Only difference is that the  Droid  is facilitating CDMA, while the Milestone uses GSM/UMTS.    So currently, we have both the  motorola-droid  (x90) and the  motorola-milestone  (x30). Should we merge them, and make one of them a synonym to the other?    A similar issue applies to the  motorola-droid-2  (x22, CDMA) and  motorola-milestone-2  (x2, GSM/UMTS) tags (see  Wikipedia  again). Owning a  Milestone 2 , I experienced the similarities in many issues (except for the CDMA versus GSM/UMTS, solutions for the one can easily be applied to the other).    As usual, my suggestion would be to merge and synonymize. I guess, tag wikis could still point out the concerning details.

 Another two synonymously used tags: All 4 questions tagged  hard-reset  deal with  factory-reset  (x67). In fact, except for one they are even tagged factory-reset additionally.    I'd suggest to merge those four questions into factory-reset, and optionally make hard-reset a synonym to factory-reset. Though Matthew may be correct that a "hard reset" originally might have referred to "hard reboot" (by removing the battery) -- everywhere I read about hard-resetting a device, the procedure decribed was in fact a factory reset.    Merging would be as easy as removing 3 tags from their respective questions, and just change a single one I guess ;)   Merge hard-reset and factory-reset? discussion  synonym-request

 As some of you may have noticed, I recently posted a community wiki question/answer  Can I use my device on a different carrier?     My intent in doing this was to try to pare down the number of questions we get which all fit into this formula. We've done this in the past with recurring questions, and I think that this is a very good candidate for a canonical question/answer. Although the questions may be specific to a phone and carrier, the answers are always inevitably the same:      Find the specs of the carrier (or available carriers, in the case of "Can I use X in country Y?")   Find the specs of the phone   Compare them to see if they run on the same networks and frequencies      In other words, I view this as a very ideal "teach a man to fish" situation, since we can readily point our users to sources which will provide the information they need rather than continuously looking up combinations of phones and carriers for them.    Ultimately, I would like to start closing questions as a duplicate of this one provided that it is well-received by the rest of the community.

 So yesterday someone upvoted more than 10 of my Questions and Answers within about a minute of each other. I recognized what it was, serial upvoting, even though it had never happened to me before. As I expected (and is right) the whole thing was reversed a few hours later.    But now today it's happened again, with even  more  posts. I expect it'll be reversed again, and it should.    I have not received any gushing comments on a recent answer that would lead me to believe that someone found it so helpful that they want to upvote  all  of my other posts.

 I recently asked a question about  preventing apps from running in the background . Before I asked it, I read several related questions and found that they didn't address the particular question space I was wondering about.    Because I was sure that some people would think my question to be a duplicate, I tried to deal with that topic when I initially wrote it, and in later edits as the controversy developed.    What I noticed (which, to be honest, wasn't unexpected) was that in both comments and answers, people kept trying to answer a different question than the one I asked--one that would have been a duplicate had I asked it.    The upshot of it all was a few down votes, the question being closed, and subsequently collecting some reopen votes. And, some people portrayed me as being unreasonable when for not changing my question to match their misconceptions of what I was really asking. (Despite my question being clearly worded, people wanted to talk about what  should  happen, or discuss how to handle a particular app instead of a general solution that might or might not exist.)    How could this situation have been handled better? How can one ask questions that are similar to but not the same as previous questions without having to fight a horde of people who falsely claim they're duplicates?

 Since Ice Cream Sandwich and Jelly Bean are 25% of the active Android devices out there, but Gingerbread is still over 50% of the active devices, it occurs to me that instructions for changing settings may look very different to people with different devices. Sure, this was a problem before, but it's more pronounced now.    Anyway, my suggestion is that if you're including instructions to someone on how to change a setting in the OS or in an app, include the version of the OS (and app) you're using as a note in your answer.     Yes, I can envision having two separate answers saying virtually the same thing, the only difference being the OS version being referenced, but I don't think that's a bad thing. It's probably better than having nearly-but-not-quite duplicate questions, different only by the OS version.   A suggestion on answers: Include OS version and app version (if applicable) discussion

 The system prevents new users from doing some actions until they have enough repution. One of these restrictions is the ability to comment on any other answers (needs 50+ reputation).    I frequently see comments posted as answers due to missing privileges. Seemingly new users  want  to contribute enough that they're willing to take the hurdle of creating an account in the first place and then notice they will need reputation points to proceed. That is however too much a hurdle and thus often an answer is posted instead of a comment.    To boot, those users' first impression is  criticism  from us for violating the rules. From the new user's perspective this may lead to frustration and some may immediately turn their back on this site.    It's  discourage malign usage  versus  lower the entrance barrier for benign users . Our site is rather low volume and I have the strong impression that our user base is split in two halves: Questioners and answerers (who share their expertise). Often really good people are rather impatient with such things.    Would it be worth thinking about relaxing the  comment everywhere  privilege?

 Last year,  Arqade  had a little promotion around the holidays called the  Hat Dash , wherein meeting certain activity thresholds would earn hats that a user's avatar could then "wear" throughout the site:         This year, Stack Exchange has decided to open up the Hat Dash to any site that decides to opt-in. The specifics:        This event will run from  19 December 2012  to  4 January 2013 . Users   will be able to see their entire hat collection on  http://winterba.sh .   That site will also have a landing page, explaining the rules and   other details of the event.         Individual users who don’t want to participate, don’t want to see   hats, and/or are generally  anti-hat will have an "I hate hats" option   available, just as we had on Gaming last year.         The only visual change to the site itself will be the presence of the   hats and the "I hate hats" button in the footer.      We need to respond by  November 28th  if the site would like to participate. Any site that does not respond by that date is considered to be opted-out.    So, what say you, people of A.SE?

 It is a bit late into this new year, being that we're already in the second month, but we are now cycling the Community Promotion Ads for 2017!    What are Community Promotion Ads?    Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.    Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?    This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:      interesting or fun Android apps   the site's twitter account   cool events or conferences   anything else your community would genuinely be interested in      The goal is for future visitors to find out about  the stuff your community deems important . This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are  relevant to your own community's interests , both for those already in the community and those yet to join.     Why do we reset the ads every year?    Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.    The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.    How does it work?    The answers you post to this question  must  conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored.        All answers should be in the exact form of:     [![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]     [1]: http://image-url    [2]: http://clickthrough-url       Please  do not add anything else to the body of the post .

 In connection with the moderator elections, we will be holding a Town Hall Chat session with the candidates. This will be an opportunity for members of the community to pose questions to the candidates on the topic of moderation.  Participation is completely voluntary. I will be working with candidates to determine a time for the event.      The Town Hall Chat took place Wednesday the 5th at 18:00:00Z UTC / 1:00 PM EST. A digest can be found  here .      Here are the details so far:      I would like to schedule this towards the beginning of the primary phase.  This means that I am looking at the 3rd-5th of December. As soon as I coordinate with the existing moderators and candidates to find a best fit based on availability, I will edit this post with details on the "when".   The Town Hall Chat will be a one-hour event using our  chat platform .  I will update this post with a direct link to the chat room once the event is scheduled.   The format will be an open discussion.  Users are encouraged to pose questions to the candidates regarding their thoughts on moderation.   Priority for scheduling is generally towards the greatest number of candidate openings as well as the earliest. Candidates who cannot show up during the live event will still be able to answer all questions posted, they will just do so at their earliest convenience.   After the chat session, a digest of the event will be permanently linked here.     2012 Moderator Election: Town Hall Chat discussion  election 
 I noticed that user  Ce4  had hyperlinks in the comments he/she made. For instance, the question " Android connected to Car system " the comment made by ce4 is as follows:      I wonder how this is achieved as I am unable to have formatting options in comments that I make, which makes the comment bit unreadable. I would be surprised if it just because of lack of in sufficient reputation as this should be available for any user as it only helps in better readability (if correctly applied  ).

 We've got a lot of tags which, in my opinion, do not make much sense. To give some examples:       app-specific tags for "minor apps" , e.g.  tunein-radio  (x1),  repligo  (x1). I fully go with tags for "major apps" which are widely used (good examples here include  google-maps  (x80) or  google-play-store  (x538). But the playstore holds over half a million apps -- we cannot provide a tag for each of them.    question-specific tags  applying to only one (or very few) very specific questions, as e.g.  zipaligned  (x1)      In my opinion, those tags are not very helpful -- but rather make tag-maintenance more difficult. So we might better...      discourage users from creating such (sure, rep already does so -- but our better-rep'd members should be aware of this and not simply jump-in when a questioner mentions "...I unfortunately lack the rep to create this tag..."   check whether we should "orphan" some of those tags, so the auto-purge cleans them up.       EDIT:  MSO mentions some  auto-cleaning task  running monthly and cleaning up single-used tags from questions aged 6+ months, so this does part of the job. So let me refine my question to:  What should we do when we just stumble-upon such an occurence where the question is, say, only 3+ months old, but the fact as such is clear?     Note also this quote from the linked MSO question:        Any tags not currently in use, or that happen to get orphaned through unusual means (rollback, merge, etc), are removed every 24 hours by a background process.      Another still remaining question is whether those two tasks apply to all stacks, as the answer just mentions 4 of them.   How to deal with "minor tags"? discussion  tag-cleanup

 Being quite new to the 10k mod tools, I just discovered a question being flaggt OT 3 times (as the question's phrasing was misunderstood, IMHO). Below the question, I see two buttons:      flag or disagree   close question      As I feel the question is perfectly on-topic, I obviously do not want to hit the second button. The first sounds promising (flag or DISAGREE) -- but only gives me the option to FLAG, not to disagree.    So how can I "decrease the flag weight" in such cases (except for adding a comment to the question pointing out the problem)?   10k tools: How to disagree with a flag? support  10k-tools 
 As it is December 2012, we are now going to reset our Community Promotion Ads for the new year.    What are Community Promotion Ads?    Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.    Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?    This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:      interesting Android apps   the site's twitter account   cool events or conferences   anything else your community would genuinely be interested in      The goal is for future visitors to find out about  the stuff your community deems important . This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are  relevant to your own community's interests , both for those already in the community and those yet to join.     Why do we reset the ads every year?    Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.    The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.    How does it work?    The answers you post to this question  must  conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored.        All answers should be in the exact form of:     [![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]     [1]: http://image-url    [2]: http://clickthrough-url       Please  do not add anything else to the body of the post . If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.     The question must always be tagged with the magic  community-ads  tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.       Image requirements      The image that you create must be  220 x 250 pixels    Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)   Must be GIF or PNG   No animated GIFs   Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB      Score Threshold    There is a  minimum score threshold  an answer must meet (currently  6 ) before it will be shown on the main site.

 I direct your attention to the  folders  tag.    It's being used for questions on:      folders on the SD card/in the filesystem (you know, what we used to call "directories" until Microsoft brainwashed us)   folders on the home screen that can hold multiple app icons   email folders   file folders become albums in the Gallery app if there are image files within (and they're picked up by the media scanner)      That's a mess.    I think the fourth issue there can be ignored; I'll be removing that tag from the offending question in just a minute.    The third issue is also probably just something that needs cleanup. I mean, do we really need to have a tag for  email-folders  that wouldn't just be covered by  email ?    The first two issues, though, definitely require disambiguation. I would suggest  homescreen-folders  for the second and either  system-folders  or  file-folders  for the first. I also think that, because it's unique to Android, that the  folders  tag should become a synonym of  homescreen-folders  (after we clean up the existing questions, of course).    I'm not sold on the names; I'd be more than happy to hear alternatives. I do think  folders  needs to be cleaned up, though.   Need to disambiguate "folders" discussion  tag-cleanup 
 The  input-method  tag seems to be used for a confusing mish-mash of topics.    Everything from  international keyboard types and IMEs , to how to  make a Submit button appear on web page form  or how to  attach a guitar to your phone's audio socket  or how to  use a joystick , these are all on the first page for the tag.    It seems to me that there's no real commonality between all those questions.    From just hearing the tag name I'd assume it was meant to refer to IMEs (Input Method Editors, usually a way to input complex characters for languages like Chinese on a keyboard with a limited number of buttons, also used to switch between different keyboard types). But I can see that most of the other questions also involve a form of input to the device.   What's the Input-Method tag for? discussion  tags 
 Should we merge the tags  power  (&times; 62),  power-management  (&times; 14  20 (merged with 'battery-manager'))? I'd suggest keeping the first tag, and making the second a synonym to it.    Many questions tagged  power  are dealing with power-management. However, there are also many dealing with powering on/off the device, which would speak for keeping them separated. In this case, we should at least re-tag the relevant questions. Note that the excerpt of the  power  tag currently reads:        For questions about power-management, power on/off, and the like.      Just noticed, the  power-management  tag wiki excerpt reads:        All about how to get the most out of your device's ressources, especially managing power consumption      Which would be quite similar to  battery-life  (oops)...

All are of the "me too" or "thanks that worked!" variety.    And yet, the question isn't "Protected".

 In AE, the most important information one can find in the majority of questions is:      Phone manufacturer-model   Android version   Rooted/not rooted   Custom ROM installed (if any)      Thus, being those tags as important as they are, don't you think it's a good idea to provide a special way to identify them?    I've been thinking about this and a couple of ideas come to my mind:      A  color scheme , just like the one being used here at Meta       Icons  to identify each one the four tag categories mentioned above, like the icons for some tags at StackOverflow (android, facebook, google-maps, etc.)         I think this would help the users to quickly identify the essential tags they should include when asking a question, thus decreasing the amount of comments like  "what brand and model of phone do you have?" ,  "are you rooted?" , etc; therefore boosting the average quality of the questions in AE.

 Everyday I see too many development questions coming up on AE. Users are responsible for this but they are not to be blamed entirely for to any new user AE  seems  to be a site related to "Everything Android." So people keep asking development questions unaware of the fact that AE is only from a user's perspective and not of a developer.    Sure, we can flag / close / delete such questions. But wouldn't it be great if we could keep users from posting such questions in the first place?    Can we make users to go through a help page or add some guidelines on the "Ask a question" page, where we can highlight the point clearly telling them not to ask development questions here and ask them to check on  StackOverflow .    This will save other users' time flagging them and moderators' time in reviewing them. Also it will help keep site cleaner. After all "Prevention is better that cure," isn't it?

 Every now and then, I run what I call a "housecleening task", walking the "unanswered" questions and see which I can answer, which are not answerable, and which might be closed. My actions are following these schema:      If I can provide an answer, I do so   If I think the question should be closed...     ...and I have close-votes left, I vote-to-close   ...otherwise I flag it for moderator attention, giving the corresponding reason      If I cannot answer the question, but maybe enhance it by a comment (asking for missing details and the like), I leave a comment   Everything else I "ignore"      This mental list I walk top-down, and break to the next question as soon as a condition was met (and the described action taken).    Currently, I'm stuck with some questions: I already v-c'd them in a previous run, so I cannot do that again. I marked some of them for moderator attention with the reason "too localized". For most of them, some mod found that reasonable. But for some I've got a "declined" with the comment:  Why? What reason is there for this to not be experienced by any other user?     Unfortunately, there's no way to respond to the question -- so I decided to put it to Meta. In this special cases, the question would be:     What makes a question "too localized?"     But that would somehow be a  XY problem . The real question to me is:     How useful is a question which is > 6 month old, having no answer (not even a hint in the comments) and a low view count (say, 10 views/month average)? How should we deal with those?     There might of course be reasons why some other user could experience a similar problem. But with no answer, the question is not useful to him. It's quite frustrating if you are looking for a solution, and everywhere you see just the question, never an answer. I wouldn't even dare asking in such cases (what sense does it make? Nobody answered that question for a long time here, so why should they do so now?). Not being helpful, and even being discouraging, and due to the low view-count obviously not that interesting to readers makes them clear candidates to be closed (or even deleted) -- at least to me.

 Some days I've noticed how my activity and statistics in Android Enthusiasts site suddenly start being registered as if they belong to next day.

 Based on the Meta question  Old questions w/o answers and low view count  we came to the conclusion: It is often quite unclear what makes a question "too localized". So we need some (at least more) clear rules on which a decision can be based. Let's start with what we have:        This question is unlikely to help any future visitors; it is only relevant to a small geographic area, a specific moment in time, or an extraordinarily narrow situation that is not generally applicable to the worldwide audience of the internet. For help making this question more broadly applicable, see the FAQ.      Which is a rather broad description: How can one tell the mentioned criteria? Some  clear numbers  would be helpful. Let me give some examples of what are  IMHO  clear candidates:      a question bein 6 month or older, having neither answers nor comments 1 , and less than 10 views/month on average   a question on a device available only in one country  AND  connected to other very local criteria (e.g. just happens with one small provider)   a question on a very specific situation which one rarely mets ("I want to sync my calendar with a [very unknown software] on my [very unknown OS]", to construct a drastic example)       1  asking the OP for additional details/making the point clearer not counted, as those are mostly in the context "what do you really want? what  is  the question here?"    Can we have more clear examples in this Meta page, which then could be linked either to the FAQ link given in the quoted text, or even directly included with this text? Could you please list up things  you  would say are very clear -- and we make a summary later (maybe even in a different Meta question, to get it clear and easy for all readers, and link back to our brain-storming here)?    Also it would be interesting to list up what is frequently  misinterpreted  as being "too localized". Today's example:  Why I am unable to check balance on BSNL Mobile in Android Phone?  This message was not yet 1 hour old, having had 12 views, and was already marked by one vote-to-close as "too localized". My guess is: One special (Japanese?) provider plus one special DualSIM phone gave the reasons of being "localized". But what if tomorrow we find the question has been viewed 2.500 times within 24 hours? "unlikely to help any future visitors"? Though it might be  geographically localized  on a first glance, it might turn out a general DualSIM problem applying world-wide!     So to sum up:      Could you all please list up, from your personal experience and feeling, what are  clear indicators  for a "too localized" question -- and what are  clear indicators  agains a message being "too localized", though it might look different on a first glance -- so we can "distill" easily understandable guidlines from it?

 I noticed someone recently edited  one of my answers  (along with the question for which the answer applied). The only edit this person made was to change the word 'wifi' to 'Wi-Fi'.    I understand that the  wikipedia entry  prefers 'Wi-Fi' as the proper terminology, but it also says it can be spelled 'wifi' (as well as 'WiFi' [no dash]).    Editing an answer simply to change wording is questionable at best, since the editor is not actually clarifying anything with the edit.    And I would argue that it makes the question and answer worse, because almost anyone would first search for 'wifi' before trying 'Wi-Fi', if they even think to search for the term with a dash at all. I tried a search with just 'wifi', and the question and my answer no longer show up.    Should these edits be reversed? Or does it make sense to change all 'wifi' to 'Wi-Fi'? If the latter, could the search engine be revised to smartly search both terms?    I do realize that the preferred 'tag' in SE is 'wi-fi', with the dash. However, I think most users will search for 'wifi', no dash.   Should the word 'wifi' be changed to 'Wi-Fi' in questions and answers? discussion  tags  editing

This looks like rage deletion to me - i.e. revenge for not complying with whatever "requested feedback" he demanded in arbitrary time period he considers "acceptable".

There's also not the slightest hint about the oldwiki:    Example here is a deeplink to Galaxy Ace' full update guide:        broken:  http:// wiki .cyanogenmod.org/wiki/Samsung_Galax...      working:  http:// oldwiki .cyanogenmod.org/wiki/Samsung_Galax...       It's not clear if old content will become available at it's current link position again, especially for old devices like the Galaxy Ace that are only officially supported until CM7.    Should we act and edit all deeplinks to wiki.cyanogenmod and change them to oldwiki... to reflect this change?   Cyanogenmod's wiki moved, should we edit our deeplinks? discussion  editing

 I draw your attention to the  emulator  tag.    The tag wiki (not so clearly) says that this is tag is for questions about (a/the) Android Emulator.    Unfortunately, it's being used for questions about any sort of emulator. (J2ME was the most recent one I saw.)    It seems to me that if nothing else the language in the tag wiki needs to be more specific.    It may make more sense to leave this as a more "generic" emulator tag and to create  android-emulator .

 I was thinking recently about how often this site gets questions related to android development that are instantly closed (because they are off-topic). And I thought of how the meta sites require a specific tag before you can post a question.    My idea is to have a tag, such as 'development'. When a user adds that tag and tries to submit the question, it returns an error and explains that development questions are out of scope for this particular SE site.    Is this doable?

 I am considering the idea of directing user questions about my open source app to Android Enthusiasts.

 I have a question I'd like to ask, but I'm not sure if it fits within the Android Enthusiasts policy, so I thought I'd post the question here to see if it is acceptable to post on the actual site.        There is a google documentation spec that defines what a device must   be capable of in order to be granted the use of "Android (TM)" for   compatibility.        I noticed that in Section 7.3.7 that devices should not have a   thermometer, and if they do, it should only measure CPU temperature.   It is not allowed in any way to measure any other temperature (ex body   heat or ambient/room temperature).        Is there a reason Google forbids thermometers? Would this type of   sensor be too inaccurate and thus bring the perceived quality of   Android down (likened to a neighborhood ordinance to keep all lawns   mowed)?"

 I've recently purchased a  Samsung Gear S3  smartwatch, and already I have some questions I'd like to ask of experienced users.    However:      I am aware that the watch's OS is Tizen-based, not Android.   My current questions have nothing to do with the watch connecting to an Android device. (In fact, my current phone, until the Galaxy S8 comes out, is still Windows-based and the watch is presently in Standalone mode.)      Considering that the watch seems primarily to target Android users (though it does support iOS), I expect there is a certain audience among this site who would be interested in and knowledgeable of the device. However, since it is not actually an Android-based device itself, I am not sure that questions which are solely about the Gear S3 would really be on-topic here.    Could someone please point me in the right direction for where questions about this watch would be on-topic within Stack Exchange, if such a site exists?

 We have the tags  monitoring  (x11) and  monitor  (x3).

Hopefully this should be enough to avoid the confusion. As tag selection involves some "auto-complete" feature, people should be able to distinguish the two.

 Again I've stumbled upon two tags which seem to describe the exactly same issue:        recovery  (x22):          The Android recovery system is a bootable partition on an Android device...        recovery-mode  (x75):          Android's recovery mode allows ROM flashing...         The only recognizable distinction to me is the viewpoint: file system ("partition") versus boot-mode. Does that justify separate tags? I'd say: let's merge them and make the then "empty one" a synonym to the other.    Remark: We also have  data-recovery  for recovering lost files. So for consistency,  recovery-mode  should IMHO be the (main) tag (also as it already holds the majority of questions), and  recovery  the synonym. I vote for a synonym as otherwise it will for sure turn up as a new tag sooner or later, referring to either the partition or the files/data.

 After having created the  insufficient-memory  including tag excerpt and wiki, now used by 10 questions, during re-tagging I discovered the  storage-full  on the last question, which is used by 9 questions currently.    Both tags are not really equivalent ( insufficient-memory  directly refers to the "insufficient memory..." error, thus dealing  exclusively  with the devices'  internal storage  -- while  storage-full  is much broader (at least from its name, though ~80% of the questions tagged such seem to explicitly refer to "insufficient memory", and the remaining 20% at least implicitly).    My idea was to merge the two, and convert  storage-full  into a synonym  for now . So if we really feel we need a separate tag by that name at a later point, it would be easy to retain. At the moment I do not see much sense in a separate broad "storage-full" tag (my, if the card is full one needs to delete something, right? Or buy a larger card).

The current 6 "translation questions" deal with topics very close to "localization", which would speak  for  a merge. A possible argument against could be the term "translation" being applied to content as well (as e.g. with "Google Translate").    Being unsure, I seek your opinions.

In the AI text it says "... for example 'Does Carrier X have prepaid plans?' ...", and from which I think what should be considered as AI should look like "I encountered this question while using Android, but it's not actually an Android problem".

Neither of us feels happy with that naming, but is was not us chosing it: it is not really an SDcard (in most cases, rather eMMC or the like). Despite of this,      newer devices use  /sdcard  as mount-point for this storage, placing the "real sdcard" to  /sdcard/external_sd  or the like   all forums, how-tos, manuals, whatever (you name it) are speaking of "internal SDCards", so a different term would cause confusion     terms like 'emmc-storage' would cause confusion (and might not always be "correct")   terms like 'flash-storage', 'phone-storage', 'device-storage', or 'internal-storage' could also apply to the area covered by  /system  (and sometimes are used referring to that explicitly, plus the latter is already used as  internal-storage  for exactly this)         Thus, as unhappy a term it might be, this would leave  internal-sd  as almost the only useful option, and we should use it (I volunteer creating it and re-tagging the questions from our current 'sd-card' tag appropriately, so the rename could be done  after  that step). If someone comes up with a better name later on, we always can rename 'internal-sd' to something more appropriate.   Merge 'external-sd' into 'sd-card' discussion  status-declined  tag-cleanup 
 The tag  scanner  (x7) is quite ambiguously used:      scanning pages (like with a flatbed-scanner) x4   WiFi/network scanner x1   malware/vulnerability scanner x1   "content scanner" (scanning a webpage for hyperlinks) x1      The weighting already makes clear that #1 should be what the tag is for. So I would go for the following:      retag #2 to  wi-fi    retag #3 to  security    retag #4 to  url  (?)   create a tag wiki for the then cleaned-up  scanner  tag to make its intention clear (though to my experience only few people even read the excerpt, we could very decently bang their heads against that wall then :)      Any comments/arguments on this?

 I just found a question tagged bot,  google-mail  (x2)  and   gmail  (x198). Does that really make sense? One could argue the former is for the service, while the latter is for the app. Wrong: Both questions tagged 'google-mail' are about the app (GMail app setup, install google apps).    Thinking about it: All our google apps tags tart with  google-*  (e.g.  google-play-[store|music|books|movies] , or  google-[maps|talk|voice|calendar|plus|...] . So a tag like  google-mail  makes absolutely sense to me, and would count as "consolidation". Hence my suggestion:    Merge the two making  google-mail  the master and  gmail  a synonym to it. There's not a lot of tag wiki for either of them (just an excerpt on  gmail  which could easily be cut'n'paste (for Germans: Guttenberg-Schavant ;)).

Suggestion:  Merge the two, and make the more-intuitive 'screen-recording' the master. This way the tag wiki is kept as well.    I'm just updating the tag wiki for  screen , including all the related tags, so this tag will be the fall-back for all issues not covered separately -- and is the most intuitive to look up in the tag wiki for existing alternatives. If the other tag wikis get updated, they might include a hint to check here ( screen ) for those, so they just need to be maintained at one place.

 The Vote to Close Review queue has been awfully active lately. While there are indeed some crap questions in there that need to be closed, there are some others that make me scratch my head.    Our rule about not allowing app recommendations is to prevent a flood of questions like        What's a good app to flurb the blag?      and nothing else.    However, I'm seeing an awful lot of questions in the review queue that      have an accepted answer   have a multiple-paragraph, detailed description of the problem the author is looking to solve   are six months old or older      That the question has a throwaway line of "what's an app that can do this?" doesn't immediately disqualify the question. Especially when the vast majority of the time the solution necessarily means an app.    I think we've lost sight of what "no app recommendations" means.    What we don't want:      Questions that are basically polls   Questions that show no research effort and are basically the OP using us as search consultants      These questions that I've been seeing in the review queue are  not  like this. They're good questions that look like they're getting close votes solely because of the fatal flaw of including a line that says "what's an app that can solve this".     I have been voting "Leave Open" on these, but as we know there can be a tendency to "dog-pile" votes, and I'm afraid that good (if slightly flawed) questions are being closed for no good reason.    So...      How can we clarify our policy?   Can the Moderators ping the users that are getting a little over-zealous with their Close votes?   Can we have an effort by a few high-rep users (and/or Moderators) to go back over some recently-Closed questions to see if any should be re-opened?

 To avoid confusion, I request we rename the  transfer  (x13) to  data-transfer .     Explanation:  We already have the  file-transfer  (x96). I just went over the questions tagged  transfer , and re-tagged a few which rather referred to  file-transfer . To avoid people confusing these two tags, IMHO we should do the above mentioned tag-rename.     Optional part:  for disambiguity, we could make  transfer  a synonym to one of the two. Some facts about background for the two tags to be considered in this case: While "file-transfer" clearly refers to "files", obviously, "data-transfer" is less clear a term. Taking a look at the questions tagged such, it refers to...      PIM data such as contacts (x4, plus 1 mixed)   messages: SMS/MMS (x4)   app-data (x2)   other data: links via bluetooth, WiFi APNs (x2)      So we could also think of creating a new  contact-transfer  tag, which would make sense, and re-tag those 4+1 questions, optionally do the same for  message-transfer , and then renaming "transfer" to "data-transfer".

 I already made a similar request about half a year ago (see:  Merge firmware and rom? ). As several other tag/retag/synonym requests, this is still open and unprocessed (i.e. neither rejected nor completed). Maybe the reason is that it's still not clear which way we should go -- but for that it doesn't help to ignore it completely.    Drawing conclusions from the discussion there, let me renew my request for work-to-be-done at that place, but put it in a little different way. We should:      Rename the  firmware  tag to 'device-firmware' and (optionally) make 'firmware' a synonym (as we already have  radio-firmware , this would be consequent; here the "radio" tag was simply dropped). Also, as Flow wrote:  In the past, if we had an ambiguous tag we specialized the name(s) . This step should be performed for sure.   Optionally, again think about merging the whole thing with the  rom , as already confirmed by Flow in his comment to the answer there:  device-firmware == rom  (interpreting SaintWacko's comment following that one: "firmware != rom" as it's not clear what firmware is meant -- which is clear with our reference to "device-firmware" as opposed to "radio-firmware").   if not performing that "optional step 2", we should consider renaming 'rom' to 'stock-rom' (as opposed to  custom-rom ), for the same reasons given for #1 (specializing names). Again, 'rom' could be made a synonym or, as in the case of 'radio-firmware', simply be "dropped" (yes, there was a "radio" tag once).

 We have tags for  video-recording ,  voice-recording ,  call-recording , and 'screen-recording' (synonym to  screencast ).

 Currently,  root  is a synonym to  rooting . I want to propose separating the two:      "rooting" concerns the process of  gaining  root access to a device, as its  tag-wiki  (including the excerpt) describes.

As usual, I volunteer to sort-out (re-tag) questions accordingly.   Diversify 'root' and 'rooting' discussion  status-completed  tag-cleanup  retag-request 
 The "general 1  off-topic" explanation text already says          Questions on Android Enthusiasts should be asked from a end-user point of view and  within the scope defined in the  help center  .

 We have tags for individual wireless carriers. Some carriers have exclusive devices for their network, and virtually all of them customize Android to add their own software. (Euphemistically known as "bloatware".)    However, it's very rare for a question to be appropriately tagged with a carrier. Almost all of the time the asker is tagging their question to describe their device, not their question.    Further:      There may not be a tag for the asker's specific, carrier-branded device   At least one tag is required, so the asker had to add  something    etc.      You can help by looking through the questions with these carrier tags and      removing the tag if the question is not about the carrier in general; remember,  carrier-specific questions are off-topic here      this is probably also an indication that the question has other tags to describe the device and not the question      confirming that it really belongs      Here are the tags with their current question counts       verizon  &times; 41    att  &times; 17    sprint  &times; 15    t-mobile  &times; 14     orange  &times; 3    virgin-mobile  &times; 2         See also:       Manufacturer tag cleanup      Carrier tag cleanup discussion  tag-cleanup 
 If nobody comes up with a good explanation what makes the two tags different, we should merge  stock-android  (&times; 63) with  vanilla-android  (&times; 28), making the first (and more intuitive for new users) the master, and the second a synonym to it.

And before somebody asks: yes, I know a stock-rom coming from e.g. Samsung is far from being vanilla. But what are people referring to when tagging a question 'stock-android'  or  'vanilla-android'?

 According to  Wikipedia , it is one and the same device:        The  HTC Sensation  is a smartphone designed and manufactured by HTC Corporation that runs the Android 2.3 Gingerbread software stock. Officially announced by HTC on April 12, 2011, the HTC Sensation was launched by Vodafone in key European markets including the United Kingdom on May 19, 2011 and by T-Mobile in the United States on June 12, 2011 ( marketed as the HTC Sensation 4G )       (emphasis mine)        htc-sensation  &times; 15    htc-sensation-4g  &times; 12      I'd suggest making the "4g" a synonym for confused US citizens :)    Question is whether to include the  htc-sensation-xe  (&times; 8) as well, as the above quote continues:        It was the first official HTC phone to support the HTC Sense 3.0 user interface. At the time of its release, the  Sensation XE  was the world's fastest Android phone.       (emphasis again mine)     Like the  Sensation XL , the XE ("Extended Edition") is a variant of the Sensation. Differences of the XE to the base model, according to Wikipedia, seem to be a faster CPU (1.5 instead of 1.2 GHz) and a bigger battery (1730 mAh instead of 1520 mAh) only -- which for our site I see not justifying a separate tag.

 Every question page has a list of related questions on the left. A few months ago, a change was rolled out on all SE sites to add a score indicator to each question in the list. On some other sites, this indicator also shows whether the question has an accepted answer.    The example below is from ux.SE. The first and third related questions do not have an accepted answer, but the second one does.         I find the answered/unanswered indication to be more useful than the question score. When looking for answers, it gives you a hint as to which related questions are likely to have the answer you're looking for. When answering questions, it gives you a hint as to which related questions might benefit from an answer you can give, or which are useful targets for "try the answers here and come back if you're still stuck" links.

 Background    I want to find out which phones have an ambient room temperature sensor, so I asked for a reference by which I could look these up.  It was immediately marked duplicate even though none of the answers to the existing question were correct for my question.    Moving on...    I asked,  https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/47143/which-phones-have-environmental-sensors-e-g-ambient-temperature-humidity-pr , and it was promptly closed as "not constructive" because...        This question is not a good fit here. It's asking for a list and it's   a list that potentially can never be complete.      But the list is apparently very small (only 1 phone) according to one commenter, and I've seen a dozen or more questions that, to me, seem similar in principle, including an entire series titled,  When will my device get the android X.Y update .  When I asked how my question is any less suitable than those, I was told,         Completely different.  Those questions are canonical references to prevent hundreds of "when will app X get Android version Y" ...      (I assume he meant, "when will  device  X get Android version Y.") By this logic and his previous reasoning, it sounds like those questions actually are not any more suitable for this site but they are allowed anyway because the mods have given up on trying to close "hundreds" of such questions.      Is this the case?  (i.e., is a special exception made for them just because so many people ask those questions?)   If so, does it follow that a canonical reference of phones' hardware specs would be allowed if there were enough people asking?   If not, then could someone please explain more clearly why a reference of android devices and supported OS versions (with release dates) is suitable while a reference of android devices and sensors is not suitable?   If this is not the place to ask my question, is there any stack exchange site where my question (or some rephrased version of it) would not be closed as  off-topic  or  not constructive ?  (Stack Overflow is not appropriate because I am not asking for coding help, and it is definitely off-topic on Super User.)   After rereading the FAQ, it sounds like  Android troubleshooting  would be a more accurate name than  Android enthusiasts  for this site. If I phrased my question in the form of a technical support question, would it then be considered appropriate for this site?  For example:  "I installed a room temperature app on a dozen different Android phones but it doesn't work on any of them (I think because they don't have ambient room temperature sensors).  What are some phones that it will work on?"   If that version is still not appropriate, why not?     Why is a canonical reference for Android versions considered appropriate but canonical reference for hardware such as sensors "not a good fit here?" discussion 
 I keep running across a ton of questions that have been closed as being not within the scope of the site, and it seems like the usefulness of this site is really being hindered by its limited scope and, to some extent, the mods themselves (no disrespect intended).  Here are some problems I've noticed just in the past day or two:      The FAQ explains that the scope is effectively just a tech support site for people having problems with their phones, which by definition means the information will become less useful and will go stale as new phones, apps, and OS versions are released.   Questions that have broadly useful information are closed so the information ends up going stale and, in some cases, becomes incorrect over time and cannot be corrected by anyone.   New questions asking for updated information that is not included in the stale answers are marked as duplicates of the old answers with little (or, in the case of a closed question, zero) hope of getting a correct answer.   In the most extreme case, I even found a community wiki answer that the mods changed to an individual answer after closing the question as "not constructive" despite being something that any true "Android Enthusiast" would actually want to know. So now nobody can edit the answer, nobody can add an updated answer, and nobody can ask the same question without getting it closed as a duplicate. Example:  Which hardware sensors are supported by Android? , 507 views in 9 months      In  More Discussion on the Scope of Android.SE , it is mentioned that the site is not for programming questions, but sometimes there are lower-level or more technical questions which are useful to programmers but not at all suitable for Stack Overflow or any other SE site.  To me, this is the type of information an enthusiast would want.  Why wouldn't one want these to be included on the "Android Enthusiasts" site?  It seems misleading for android.stackexchange.com to be so limited in its scope.    Or, to put it another way...    In any other discipline (automotive, electronics, underwater basket weaving, etc.), an  "enthusiast"  is defined as someone who mods, tinkers with, completely understands the internals and mechanics of the subject matter, and who pushes the machinery and materials to their limits and beyond--in fewer words, an  expert in the field .  But it seems like  Android Enthusiasts  is much more watered-down, to the point that its only target demographic is Jane or Joe User who is having a problem with his or her phone, and the site perhaps would be more aptly named  Android Owners  or  Android Tech Support .  Although I certainly can appreciate the need for that type of content, it seems like the current scope as outlined in the FAQ and enforced by the mods unnecessarily creates a need for yet another Android site that specifically caters to enthusiasts as the term is applied to other disciplines.  I would think you'd want as many of these people as possible to use and promote the site, but instead you're basically telling the most excited Android experts and evangelists to go back to xda-developers and other forum-based sites which are very poorly-suited for Q&amp;A-style discussions.    The Question    Most other Stack Exchange sites aim to be the singular canonical reference on their domain, crushing most other sites that previously were the better-known resources.  But it seems Android Enthusiasts considers everything  but specific technical support questions to be off-topic (except in a few cases, where questions normally considered inappropriate for the site are allowed simply because people would otherwise keep re-asking those same questions hundreds of times).  Why is the scope of Android Enthusiasts so severely limited?  Is it simply because there aren't enough mods, or is it something deeper?   Why is the scope of Android Enthusiasts so small? discussion 
 The answer to  this  question which was automatically turned into a community-wiki post not long ago is now, once again a non-wiki post! I checked the 'activity' section of my user profile page.

 My answer  here  got put into community wiki status automatically because I edited it lots (I was also the only editor).     From my understanding, once an answer becomes a community wiki, the original answerer no longer receives rep from upvotes to the answer, but I am still receiving reputation on upvotes to that answer since it went to wiki (It went to wiki on June 11, 22:13Z, but I got an upvote rep from it on June 18, 18:19Z).    Does that not apply to answers that received wiki status via mass-editing when all the editing was done by the original answerer or is this a bug?   Should Community wiki answers converted via editing still be granting rep to the original answerer? bug  reputation  community-wiki

 The new  rework of the close vote system  has rolled out network-wide, which brings with it a handful of changes. One of these is that we can now define up to  three  sub-reasons and modify the default close reason to select from when choosing to close a question. We currently have the following choices:    Default Close Reason        This question does not appear to be about $Topic, within the scope   defined in the [help].      Custom Close Reasons    1.)        Questions about  software development  are off-topic here, but can   be asked on  Stack Overflow .      2.)

(empty)      This leaves us with the ability to add one more and/or replace (or simply eliminate) the current two, also we can change the default close reason.

 I recently came across  this answer  and found out that the answering user has provided his email address in  username (at) domain (dot) com  format.     Even though I overlooked it, on a second thought it occurred to me that the primary goal of the Android Enthusiasts (or any other StackExchange site for that matter) might be lost, as we all are here to help and get help in a way that  even  third parties 1  are also benefited.    So my question is should we or should we not allow these kinds of practices in the site? If yes, up to what extent should this be done? What if there is a (rare) case that the answers cannot be obtained without some direct help, which involves some level of discretion? What are the options available to such a user?

 I have Request Policy on Firefox, which blocks external files from a website unless it has been whitelisted. Randomly today, I noticed it was blocking a  user's  profile image. Apparently, this person has their image hosted on Facebook.    How exactly does someone link to an external site for their photo? When I go to change my image, I only get the option to upload a photo (which itself is a relatively new feature) or use Gravatar.    Is it Gravatar that is linking to the image externally? I haven't used the Gravatar image ever since uploading my own, so I don't remember how it sotred/linked images.    Or is the "upload photo from web" option actually just linking instead of copying to the StackExchange network?   How can a user profile picture be hosted on Facebook or other external site? discussion 
 This is presumably going to become more relevant, and have a bigger backlog over time as things change, but what's prompted this thought right now is  Google's recent closure and total shut-down of Google Reader .    Now that there is absolutely no way to use either the Google Reader website, the Android Google Reader app, or the Google Reader API an awful lot of the questions in  google-reader  just aren't relevant or useful any more. While some of them are really more generic RSS related questions that happen to have the Google Reader tag, many of the others are very specific question about the app or service. While I don't think that these necessarily need deleting (there are answers on there that were previously good and useful, and they don't deserve to lose the associated rep just because things have changed), there's also no reason to leave the question open when it's never going to receive another good answer.    Previously these would have been a good candidate to "Vote-To-Close" as " Too Localized "  (in time)  but  there is no "Too Localized" reason any more . What should we do with these types of questions?    Edit: should probably also point out that Google Reader is just a topical example. In the future this could also apply to many other commonly used services that rely on a backend provided by a single company, eg Facebook, GMail, Twitter, Skydrive, Flickr, Dropbox and so on.   What should we do with older questions that just aren't relevant any more? discussion  close-reasons

 When I was reviewing a  question  today, I tried to make some changes to the title and content of the question. This is something I have done before with no problem, but this time I ran into an error message:        This edit would have to be a suggested edit.      As I have less than 2000 reputation points, I have always done suggested edits; I lack permissions to do anything but.    What is this error message? It is useless to me,     Could it be related to the fact that I am so close to 2000 points? Has the suggested edit functionality been changed with the recent overhaul of closing/holding questions? Is there supposed to be a checkbox saying this is a suggested edit? I'm just throwing out possible avenues; I really have no idea what the problem is.    A  google search  for the exact error message string come back with 0 results, though I suspect in a few minutes there will be a single result for this question. This leads some credence to the error being a new backend change (and probably a bug at that), since no one else has run into it yet.     Edit : Now when I go to that specific question, the  edit  button is disabled. It isn't disabled for other questions, though. Even on a closed (duplicate) question with a user that has reputation 1, I have an active  edit  button. What is unique about that question?     Edit 2 : The question has been edited by someone else, and I now could edit the question if I so choose.

 I was surprised to find out just now that I had earned the  Civic Duty  badge. The badge requirement is to vote 300 times.    However, when looking at my profile, I see that the  Votes Cast  votes tab shows only 267 votes.

 I was contacted privately by an OP of this  question  (now deleted).        Hi I am the same guy with as here. I found your email by googling your DN . Sorry for contacting you via email but it is really getting very difficult for me to debug the problem. Would you mind if I ask you to come over skype or something like that?         I am kind of getting desperate since its only a 6 month old phone without any warranty.         Regards      In my book, it is highly unfair seeking one on one support to resolve the issue, however, time and personal life, working etc... it is deemed unfair to put me in the spot and also unfair on the community, notice how the email sounds desperate and not being patient enough to wait for turn-around time for someone else on this site to answer, nor being patient either does not help.    Sending one on one private email should not be allowed on a community site unless contacted by way of message, or even chat, but on email... no...     What is the best course of action?    Edit    Just noticed that the OP now has supplied the answer to their own question...  sigh      This  from, another forum (directly quoted from Modaco), sums it up succinctly.        It is extremely rude and unfair to contact a person directly and   expecting personal 1-on-1 support. They have personal lives away from   the forum and this should be respected.        If you have any questions then ask them in the relevant forum thread.   If you do not receive an answer straight away then wait. Sometimes it   may take more than 24 hours for somebody to reply to you. If you do   not find the answer you are looking for or do not get a reply then try   re-wording your question giving as much information as possible. Logs   are useful, screenshots are useful.        These forums are a community and by asking questions openly you are   helping other members. Asking questions privately is rude and   inconsiderate to ASE users, and not fair on the rest of the community.     Getting contacted privately discussion  etiquette

 I was going to update the wiki question  How do I root my Android device?  to include the Samsung Galaxy S4, but I wanted to make sure the update I was going to add was following the proper formatting, linking, etc. for the answer.     I was going to add the Galaxy S4 and link to this xda post:      http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2290798     However it seems to be limited to Verizon and doesn't work on the most recent Build release.

 I struggled for a while reading  this question  where the OP was asking for a consistent answer about the Android battery, battery calibration and battery usage.    He pointed out several answers from different users that present a conflict on advices on how should an Android user proceed with battery maintenance and usage.    The question raised on my head after reading this was:     Are we giving the appropriated information about battery usage and maintenance?      that in turn lead me here to discuss this matter, because if we've got contradictory information, some one is wrong or the specifics of each situation require a more careful explanation about the battery maintenance and usage.

 In reference to  Where can I find stock or custom ROMs for my Android device?     Lately the answer has gotten a few fairly localized additions that I have edited out.

 A User just marked three different questions and three different answers as duplicates and I challenge anyone to review them.       Heimdall errors, “ERROR: Failed to detect compatible download-mode device.”     Heimdall errors, “ERROR: Partition ”recovery“ does not exist in the specified PIT.”     Heimdall errors, “ERROR: Failed to confirm end of file transfer sequence!”       According to @t0mmb13b, 1 is a dupe of 2. 2 is a dupe of 3. And, 3 is a dupe of 1 and 2. This is nothing short of a total failure to read any of them. I took time to enter these errors into android.stackexchange.com. I didn't do it for me, I did it for others that may run into these problems with Heimdall.  They're all self-answered . And, all of these shared a similar format in the title for easy disambiguation by visitors and search engines. All of these errors are caused by different symptoms so I'll summarize them here.     The numbers correspond to the above       This is caused by the device not being in  download mode . The device must be put in a different mode.   This is caused by the command's partition argument being lowercase. This is really awkward for a Linux/GNU guy, because  heimdall (5)  breaks convention, that  --argument  is the same as  --ARGUMENT , what should have happened is that  heimdall  should have done  --partition_name "ARGUMENT"  instead. For those who make these most basic-assumptions about Linux utilities, Heimdall is likely to cause confusion. The error message heimdall produces is also useless for most people.   This is caused by a bug in a release candidate of  heimdall . It simply needs to be updated. Why is this important if it's just a release candidate then? Simple,  heimdall  is frozen at 1.4rc1 in the  Ubuntu repository .      Users need to read the questions and answers before they comment. This kind of closing of questions and answers just discourages involvement.

Just vote/flag them as appropriate.     Remember: we don't migrate crap.     Pro-tip #1    If you are removing tags from a large number of questions, it's better to go to the last question on the last page of all questions with that tag and work your way backwards. This prevents you from having to deal with the cache not reflecting your edits on the question list combined with browser-cache issues.    If you haven't visited most of these questions, you'll know what you changed because the link for the question will have a different color.    Pro-tip #2    Please edit in small batches and be mindful of front-page flooding – we don't want the entire front page to be filled with edits of old questions. Do three or five edits at a time, then come back later.       Let us know when a tag has been cleaned up. Even better, let us know about tags you think need cleaning.

  Froyo  and  Gingerbread  each added a lot of changes compared to their predecessors.  Honeycomb  caused a lot of confusion, what with it only ever being available for a very few tablets.  Ice Cream Sandwich  was a big deal, with a  lot  of changes. Each of the  Jelly   Bean   iterations , less so (although "Project Butter" was a significant improvement).    The idea with the first of these Community Wiki questions was to act as a repository of knowledge and to short-circuit the plethora of "When will {name of device} get Android {version}?" questions that we saw.     Are these still needed?     By all indications, the Nexus 5 and Android 4.4 (KitKat&reg;) are going to be released in about four weeks. The last few Nexus devices will get it (those not encumbered by carrier customizations, that is, like my Verizon Galaxy Nexus) and the flagship devices of the big OEMs within a few months.    But will we really be saving ourselves from a bunch of "When will {name of device} get Android 4.4?" questions if we make another Community Wiki?    Google has done a lot to move key functionality out of the OS into updateable apps/services. (By golly, remember when we had to get an Android update to get a new Gmail?) There's not much of anything in Android 4.3 that I feel like I'm missing on my VZW GNex at 4.2.2. Things are much different now than when a new version of the OS made the device feel brand new.    Also, it takes time and effort to keep those lists updated. Even though they're Community Wiki, I've only ever seen a handful of people add information to the answers. Plus, they get out-dated. No one is clamoring for information on Froyo or Gingerbread, and few are still looking for information on Ice Cream Sandwich. Anyone still on prior versions there have resigned themselves to the version they have or have taking the plunge with a custom ROM.    So, should we continue to create and maintain these Community Wiki Android version questions/answers?    More importantly, if we don't,  how should we handle the inevitable  "When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"  questions?    Is it time to stop with the "When will my device get Android X.X" questions? discussion

 A minor issue to be sure, and perhaps an edge case, but...    When a user has a fairly high reputation and a good number of badges, and edits a post by someone else, the user card can get truncated. Like so:         Note that the "106" next to the bronze badge icon is overwritten by the user card next to it.    This is on Google Chrome 29. I also see it on Firefox 23 but not IE 10.

 (Prompted by  this question .)    Games are  big  on Android. They're a  huge category on the Play Store , and the Play Store app shows Games at the same level as Apps (as well as Movies &amp; TV, Music, Books, and Magazines).    There have been  very few   games  questions asked here, and the vast majority of those have been about trying to get a game to run on a particular device or to save/export the save-game data to reload after a factory reset or onto another device. (And, frankly, a good bunch of mis-tagged questions that are only about "games" insofar as the app the person is trying to work with happens to be a game, but I digress.)    However, our help center makes no mention of games and questions about gameplay, either that they are or are not on-topic. I think we should rectify that.

 The following tags are overly broad, misapplied,  meta tags    1    2  , ambiguous or are otherwise problematic.       untagged  These are questions that are missing any sort of tag whatsoever. Either the question was migrated here and there were no tags that matched from the sending system, it uses a tag that only had one use and was thus dropped, or some other weirdness. Please tag appropriately.    html5  Not sure what's going on here. At the very least should be tagged instead with  html , but that tag is problematic too.     macros  Would seem to be covered by the  automation  tag. Probably need a synonym here.

Important    Do not simply fix the tag and nothing else. Very often there are multiple inappropriate tags, not to mention there are almost always spelling, grammar, and/or formatting issues to be addressed.  Fix the whole question . While you're at it, check any answers on the question for similar issues.    On the other hand, don't bother fixing questions that should be closed and/or deleted. Just vote/flag them as appropriate.     Remember: we don't migrate crap.     Pro-tip #1    If you are removing tags from a large number of questions, it's better to go to the last question on the last page of all questions with that tag and work your way backwards. This prevents you from having to deal with the cache not reflecting your edits on the question list combined with browser-cache issues.    If you haven't visited most of these questions, you'll know what you changed because the link for the question will have a different color.    Pro-tip #2    Please edit in small batches and be mindful of front-page flooding – we don't want the entire front page to be filled with edits of old questions. Do three or five edits at a time, then come back later.       Let us know when a tag has been cleaned up. Even better, let us know about tags you think need cleaning.

 We get a lot of spam answers (and I've just seen a spam edit) with links to domains selling dubious software. There are a few websites that claim to offer tutorials for recovering data from a broken phone, but the "tutorial" is an advert for PC software.    The links are added indiscriminately by newly registered or anonymous users, often to inappropriate questions, and also sometimes to questions where they would be a reasonable answer. The text themselves is often spammy-looking, repeating the same phrasing several times or pasting text from their site, for SEO purposes. Even when the answers are sometimes relevant, I don't think we ought to encourage commercial users to follow this scatter-shot approach and rely on our users spending time deciding which posts might be appropriate.    The websites in question look suspicious because (1) they don't give any contact details or official information on the company selling the software, not even a country of origin; (2) they offer a PC software download for an Android problem; (3) they have heavy use of SEO keywords, often with a separate URL per device; (4) often they hide their WHOIS information to make sure you can't find out who they are. These are not properties of honest software businesses.    Domains I've seen people try to link to include:      istonsoft.com (hidden whois information)   swesoft.com (based in CN)   android-data-recovery-software.com (same owner as swesoft)   z0download.com (hidden whois information;  here's a huge edit that added this link )   yodot.com (hidden whois information;  here's an answer )   android-mobile-manager.com (hidden whois information)      We have a zillion questions on recovering deleted files, and AFAICT they all attract this kind of spammy answer/edit. Certainly, several have been protected for this reason. I'm proposing to reduce the number of spam answers/edits that get through review, and to reduce the load on reviewers, by stopping our repeat offenders earlier.   Can we blacklist some domains to reduce spam? discussion 
 It's the time of the year again, namely it is December 2013, and so we shall now refresh our Community Promotion Ads for the new year.    What are Community Promotion Ads?    Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.    Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?    This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:      interesting Android apps   the site's twitter account   cool events or conferences   anything else your community would genuinely be interested in      The goal is for future visitors to find out about  the stuff your community deems important . This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are  relevant to your own community's interests , both for those already in the community and those yet to join.     Why do we reset the ads every year?    Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.    The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.    How does it work?    The answers you post to this question  must  conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored.        All answers should be in the exact form of:     [![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]     [1]: http://image-url    [2]: http://clickthrough-url       Please  do not add anything else to the body of the post . If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.     The question must always be tagged with the magic  community-ads  tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.       Image requirements      The image that you create must be  220 x 250 pixels    Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)   Must be GIF or PNG   No animated GIFs   Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB      Score Threshold    There is a  minimum score threshold  an answer must meet (currently  6 ) before it will be shown on the main site.

 Here's a project for us non-Moderators:    The tag  multiple-accounts  appears to be covering much of the same ground as  multi-user .    The tag wiki of the latter currently states:        Multi-user is a term that defines an operating system, computer program, or a game that allows use by more than one users of the same computer at the same time. Android 4.2 Jelly Bean brought multi-user support to Android tablets.      So, it looks like  multiple-accounts  is a candidate to be a synonym for  multi-user , but it's not currently "clean" enough to force a re-tag.    Here's the project: Go through each of the (currently) 21 questions tagged  multiple-accounts  and retag them appropriately. At the very least, anything that is tagged  multiple-accounts   and   multi-user  the former is redundant and should be removed. Also, if there are other issues with the question, fix those too.    Once cleaned up to the degree possible we can either let the tag die, set it as a synonym, or, if there are still some questions using it, define an appropriate wiki definition.

 Preamble    I have read the   META   and the   WIKI   product of it and then followed by the self answered   META   so just wanted to make clear I am not asking this question lightly or without extensive reading and research of existing discussion. I just feel that some valuable (however subtle) perspective is missing in the decision to generalize discussion on this subject due possibly to the lack of actual development experience or participation in the evolution of the HIY. Either of these would make it clear that while many might be lazy players who are shopping for "cool" things to check out and play with, there are those who legitimately want to learn about their device, explore its capabilities and expand on them if possible. We should be focused on the latter and not deprive more in depth discussion for fear of the "shoppers" as they have been called. The benefit far outweighs any sinister abuse which can be easily moderated out.    Argument    I believe that there is a very legitimate case to be made for allowing more than cursory discussion on custom ROMs this community is dedicated to Android and part of that is the open source and customization nature of it. This means that people try to expand functionality, remove limitations and all in all try to develop a better experience. While as professionals we might argue that general sources are sufficient to decide for one's self what to do and how to go about exploring the options, what happens to the more novice members who look to a community such as this for insight, expertise, shared experience knowledge and assistance.    Why not allow a user to say, I am using Device X from Provider Y and I would like to find a ROM that allows me to remove the bloatware that was installed on there and expand functionality, GUI, tweaks, and so on; what would work best with my setup? People who can apply their general knowledge to help narrow the sea of ROMs and suggest a few can help. Those who own the same device and have experimented with various ROMs can share their experiences first hand and make suggestions and give notes and warnings. Those who own the device but were too green or unaware of a way to expand functionality can benefit by learning from the discussion. It can serve as a truly great way to engage the masses and while some devices might be extremely localized and limited in scope, others will be useful to a much greater range of people. Either way, it will make this community a beacon of knowledge that has been amassed and shared. Who does it hurt to discuss specifics? For every 1 person who is active in the discussion there are 100's if not more who are benefiting from reading and referencing the discussion. Long after it has been resolved for the OP, the discussion will remain for any future seeker who find it and resolves their problem, living up to the goal of such a community.     Isn't that what we want? I don't understand sometimes the elitist approach taken to what question is allowed and what is not. If it relates to Android, however broad or narrow, its relevant and should be allowed, as long as it is not abusive, offensive, illegal, or promotion. Thoughts?

  This question  has a bunch of development-related keywords like "build" "development" and "package".    However it is not really a question about "developing  for  Android", it's about "developing  on  Android". Using Android as a development platfrom is, in the concept of Android,  using , not developing.    It's asking about missing shared library symbols, and after searching on Google, I found the answer is "Build ZeroMQ from scratch by yourself". This answer is, however, off-topic on Android. But it does not affect the question.    In short, the question is similar to        I wrote a program on Android using Termux, and the dynamic linker said it's missing a symbol "pw->pw_gecos".      So what? I can well remember Dan Hulme ♦ said (from my memory, exact wording may vary)        If your question is about using Android as a development platform, it's OK. But if you ask something like "I wrote this code on my Android phone, what's wrong with it", it's clearly off-topic      I can't find the quotation above but I'm fairly sure it's said by Dan Hulme somewhere on this site (A.M.SE).

 It seems to me that the quality of this SE site is low. Most questions appear to be about minor issues/bugs rather than Android itself. Should something be done about the quality or allowed topic?

See  ( https://android.stackexchange.com/tour ) - " Questions with too many possible answers, or that would require an extremely long answer ". The user in the above link asks for possible risks, which is not easily answered question, thus breaking the quoted rule. Yet, this user's question received many upvotes.

 This is inspired from this answer to my question -  Can there be malicious apps on Google Play?         Aside of that: In case you're still unsure, pick a good forum and ask. Another good idea is to check other apps from the same developer (just follow the link on his name), and use above criteria on them.      Since currently finding an ad-free application is not easy, is it OK to ask for recommendations (i.e. for example "Can someone recommend an ad-free FTP server that is not a virus")?.

 I've seen in an unanswered question that an user posted what seems to be an answer as a  comment . That user has not posted it as an answer although someone suggested him to do so (maybe he has not logged in since then so he is not aware of this). It has passed more than a year after that comment, and no one has answered the question. There are probably people who are going through the same situation described in this question, but seeing that there is still no answer they desist to clicking on it, likely ignoring the comment with which the user gave the right answer to his own question.     A simple solution would be to copy and paste the comment as my own answer, winning reputation at the expense of someone else's effort, but exactly that makes it an  unethical  action.

 Of late I have observed that a few questions have been raised, which on close inspection  look off-topic  however were carrying an active bounty.    In one case, I tried to  salvage the post  with significant edits to make sure that OP could perhaps get an answer that solves their issue at least also to avoid unnecessary wastage of bounty rep (hard earned rep) from the OP's point of view.     Recently there came another  post with active bounty  which I reckon can be deemed  off-topic  (asking for app recommendations), but in this case I am not too sure how this can be handled. I also think the OP was looking for a different way to solve the problem and not strictly app recommendation, however the investor seems to be looking for an application.    In this case how can off-topic (or low quality posts) be handled when they carry an active bounty, AFAICT, under normal circumstances, such posts are put on hold to allow OP to revise the posts (and then re-open or closed)?
