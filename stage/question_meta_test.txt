 As it is December 2012, we are now going to reset our Community Promotion Ads for the new year.    What are Community Promotion Ads?    Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.    Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?    This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:      interesting Android apps   the site's twitter account   cool events or conferences   anything else your community would genuinely be interested in      The goal is for future visitors to find out about  the stuff your community deems important . This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are  relevant to your own community's interests , both for those already in the community and those yet to join.     Why do we reset the ads every year?    Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.    The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.    How does it work?    The answers you post to this question  must  conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored.        All answers should be in the exact form of:     [![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]     [1]: http://image-url    [2]: http://clickthrough-url       Please  do not add anything else to the body of the post . If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.     The question must always be tagged with the magic  community-ads  tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.       Image requirements      The image that you create must be  220 x 250 pixels    Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)   Must be GIF or PNG   No animated GIFs   Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB      Score Threshold    There is a  minimum score threshold  an answer must meet (currently  6 ) before it will be shown on the main site.    You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats  here .   Community Promotion Ads - 2013 discussion  community-ads 
 I direct your attention to the  folders  tag.    It's being used for questions on:      folders on the SD card/in the filesystem (you know, what we used to call "directories" until Microsoft brainwashed us)   folders on the home screen that can hold multiple app icons   email folders   file folders become albums in the Gallery app if there are image files within (and they're picked up by the media scanner)      That's a mess.    I think the fourth issue there can be ignored; I'll be removing that tag from the offending question in just a minute.    The third issue is also probably just something that needs cleanup. I mean, do we really need to have a tag for  email-folders  that wouldn't just be covered by  email ?    The first two issues, though, definitely require disambiguation. I would suggest  homescreen-folders  for the second and either  system-folders  or  file-folders  for the first. I also think that, because it's unique to Android, that the  folders  tag should become a synonym of  homescreen-folders  (after we clean up the existing questions, of course).    I'm not sold on the names; I'd be more than happy to hear alternatives. I do think  folders  needs to be cleaned up, though.   Need to disambiguate "folders" discussion  tag-cleanup 
 The  input-method  tag seems to be used for a confusing mish-mash of topics.    Everything from  international keyboard types and IMEs , to how to  make a Submit button appear on web page form  or how to  attach a guitar to your phone's audio socket  or how to  use a joystick , these are all on the first page for the tag.    It seems to me that there's no real commonality between all those questions.    From just hearing the tag name I'd assume it was meant to refer to IMEs (Input Method Editors, usually a way to input complex characters for languages like Chinese on a keyboard with a limited number of buttons, also used to switch between different keyboard types). But I can see that most of the other questions also involve a form of input to the device.   What's the Input-Method tag for? discussion  tags 
 Should we merge the tags  power  (&times; 62),  power-management  (&times; 14  20 (merged with 'battery-manager'))? I'd suggest keeping the first tag, and making the second a synonym to it.    Many questions tagged  power  are dealing with power-management. However, there are also many dealing with powering on/off the device, which would speak for keeping them separated. In this case, we should at least re-tag the relevant questions. Note that the excerpt of the  power  tag currently reads:        For questions about power-management, power on/off, and the like.      Just noticed, the  power-management  tag wiki excerpt reads:        All about how to get the most out of your device's ressources, especially managing power consumption      Which would be quite similar to  battery-life  (oops)...   Tag merge: power, power-management discussion  status-completed  synonym-request  tag-cleanup 
 Obviously both are the very same thing. I'd suggest to merge them and converting the remaining one (depending on which is the merging target) into a synonym.   Merge wifi-hotspot and wifi-tethering? discussion  synonym-request 
 I direct your attention to this question:  How to import contacts from symbian mobile to android mobile?     It has, as of this moment, five deleted answers. All are of the "me too" or "thanks that worked!" variety.    And yet, the question isn't "Protected".    It was my understanding that if  a question gets three deleted answers from low-rep users attached to it, it automatically gets "Protected" status  to help prevent these sorts of non-answer answers.    Did the automatic status change not happen? Or was it removed for some reason?   Question not automatically protected support  bug  status-bydesign  protected-questions 
 In AE, the most important information one can find in the majority of questions is:      Phone manufacturer-model   Android version   Rooted/not rooted   Custom ROM installed (if any)      Thus, being those tags as important as they are, don't you think it's a good idea to provide a special way to identify them?    I've been thinking about this and a couple of ideas come to my mind:      A  color scheme , just like the one being used here at Meta       Icons  to identify each one the four tag categories mentioned above, like the icons for some tags at StackOverflow (android, facebook, google-maps, etc.)         I think this would help the users to quickly identify the essential tags they should include when asking a question, thus decreasing the amount of comments like  "what brand and model of phone do you have?" ,  "are you rooted?" , etc; therefore boosting the average quality of the questions in AE.

 I know we allow 1 "How do I root" question per device and in  this meta post  it says:        ....one post per device. These questions should each have one answer with a complete rooting guide that addresses all software versions,      However, what do we do if a user is asking for a rooting solution for a different build than the one in an already existing post? For example, do we consider  https://android.stackexchange.com/q/35826/7574  a duplicate of  How to root the new version of the ONE X ?

 Everyday I see too many development questions coming up on AE. Users are responsible for this but they are not to be blamed entirely for to any new user AE  seems  to be a site related to "Everything Android." So people keep asking development questions unaware of the fact that AE is only from a user's perspective and not of a developer.    Sure, we can flag / close / delete such questions. But wouldn't it be great if we could keep users from posting such questions in the first place?    Can we make users to go through a help page or add some guidelines on the "Ask a question" page, where we can highlight the point clearly telling them not to ask development questions here and ask them to check on  StackOverflow .    This will save other users' time flagging them and moderators' time in reviewing them. Also it will help keep site cleaner. After all "Prevention is better that cure," isn't it?    I am not sure how valid is my suggestion and if it can actually be implemented. So that's also a part of my question here.

 Every now and then, I run what I call a "housecleening task", walking the "unanswered" questions and see which I can answer, which are not answerable, and which might be closed. My actions are following these schema:      If I can provide an answer, I do so   If I think the question should be closed...     ...and I have close-votes left, I vote-to-close   ...otherwise I flag it for moderator attention, giving the corresponding reason      If I cannot answer the question, but maybe enhance it by a comment (asking for missing details and the like), I leave a comment   Everything else I "ignore"      This mental list I walk top-down, and break to the next question as soon as a condition was met (and the described action taken).    Currently, I'm stuck with some questions: I already v-c'd them in a previous run, so I cannot do that again. I marked some of them for moderator attention with the reason "too localized". For most of them, some mod found that reasonable. But for some I've got a "declined" with the comment:  Why? What reason is there for this to not be experienced by any other user?     Unfortunately, there's no way to respond to the question -- so I decided to put it to Meta. In this special cases, the question would be:     What makes a question "too localized?"     But that would somehow be a  XY problem . The real question to me is:     How useful is a question which is > 6 month old, having no answer (not even a hint in the comments) and a low view count (say, 10 views/month average)? How should we deal with those?     There might of course be reasons why some other user could experience a similar problem. But with no answer, the question is not useful to him. It's quite frustrating if you are looking for a solution, and everywhere you see just the question, never an answer. I wouldn't even dare asking in such cases (what sense does it make? Nobody answered that question for a long time here, so why should they do so now?). Not being helpful, and even being discouraging, and due to the low view-count obviously not that interesting to readers makes them clear candidates to be closed (or even deleted) -- at least to me.

 Based on the Meta question  Old questions w/o answers and low view count  we came to the conclusion: It is often quite unclear what makes a question "too localized". So we need some (at least more) clear rules on which a decision can be based. Let's start with what we have:        This question is unlikely to help any future visitors; it is only relevant to a small geographic area, a specific moment in time, or an extraordinarily narrow situation that is not generally applicable to the worldwide audience of the internet. For help making this question more broadly applicable, see the FAQ.      Which is a rather broad description: How can one tell the mentioned criteria? Some  clear numbers  would be helpful. Let me give some examples of what are  IMHO  clear candidates:      a question bein 6 month or older, having neither answers nor comments 1 , and less than 10 views/month on average   a question on a device available only in one country  AND  connected to other very local criteria (e.g. just happens with one small provider)   a question on a very specific situation which one rarely mets ("I want to sync my calendar with a [very unknown software] on my [very unknown OS]", to construct a drastic example)       1  asking the OP for additional details/making the point clearer not counted, as those are mostly in the context "what do you really want? what  is  the question here?"    Can we have more clear examples in this Meta page, which then could be linked either to the FAQ link given in the quoted text, or even directly included with this text? Could you please list up things  you  would say are very clear -- and we make a summary later (maybe even in a different Meta question, to get it clear and easy for all readers, and link back to our brain-storming here)?    Also it would be interesting to list up what is frequently  misinterpreted  as being "too localized". Today's example:  Why I am unable to check balance on BSNL Mobile in Android Phone?  This message was not yet 1 hour old, having had 12 views, and was already marked by one vote-to-close as "too localized". My guess is: One special (Japanese?) provider plus one special DualSIM phone gave the reasons of being "localized". But what if tomorrow we find the question has been viewed 2.500 times within 24 hours? "unlikely to help any future visitors"? Though it might be  geographically localized  on a first glance, it might turn out a general DualSIM problem applying world-wide!     So to sum up:      Could you all please list up, from your personal experience and feeling, what are  clear indicators  for a "too localized" question -- and what are  clear indicators  agains a message being "too localized", though it might look different on a first glance -- so we can "distill" easily understandable guidlines from it?

 I noticed someone recently edited  one of my answers  (along with the question for which the answer applied). The only edit this person made was to change the word 'wifi' to 'Wi-Fi'.    I understand that the  wikipedia entry  prefers 'Wi-Fi' as the proper terminology, but it also says it can be spelled 'wifi' (as well as 'WiFi' [no dash]).    Editing an answer simply to change wording is questionable at best, since the editor is not actually clarifying anything with the edit.    And I would argue that it makes the question and answer worse, because almost anyone would first search for 'wifi' before trying 'Wi-Fi', if they even think to search for the term with a dash at all. I tried a search with just 'wifi', and the question and my answer no longer show up.    Should these edits be reversed? Or does it make sense to change all 'wifi' to 'Wi-Fi'? If the latter, could the search engine be revised to smartly search both terms?    I do realize that the preferred 'tag' in SE is 'wi-fi', with the dash. However, I think most users will search for 'wifi', no dash.   Should the word 'wifi' be changed to 'Wi-Fi' in questions and answers? discussion  tags  editing 
 I have seen that there are so many questions that has acceptable answers without the OP has not accepted. I have seen this issue has addressed to a  certain  extent in  some questions . Yet, it is about unanswered questions.     So is there a way to notify users who have questions with no  accepted  answers to check their questions?

This looks like rage deletion to me - i.e. revenge for not complying with whatever "requested feedback" he demanded in arbitrary time period he considers "acceptable".

 I have a question I'd like to ask, but I'm not sure if it fits within the Android Enthusiasts policy, so I thought I'd post the question here to see if it is acceptable to post on the actual site.        There is a google documentation spec that defines what a device must   be capable of in order to be granted the use of "Android (TM)" for   compatibility.        I noticed that in Section 7.3.7 that devices should not have a   thermometer, and if they do, it should only measure CPU temperature.   It is not allowed in any way to measure any other temperature (ex body   heat or ambient/room temperature).        Is there a reason Google forbids thermometers?

 I've recently purchased a  Samsung Gear S3  smartwatch, and already I have some questions I'd like to ask of experienced users.    However:      I am aware that the watch's OS is Tizen-based, not Android.   My current questions have nothing to do with the watch connecting to an Android device. (In fact, my current phone, until the Galaxy S8 comes out, is still Windows-based and the watch is presently in Standalone mode.)      Considering that the watch seems primarily to target Android users (though it does support iOS), I expect there is a certain audience among this site who would be interested in and knowledgeable of the device. However, since it is not actually an Android-based device itself, I am not sure that questions which are solely about the Gear S3 would really be on-topic here.    Could someone please point me in the right direction for where questions about this watch would be on-topic within Stack Exchange, if such a site exists?    Sample question (currently the only one I have in mind):        "Can I change the time display format for the built-in digital watch faces on my Gear S3?"

 I just discovered we've got the tags  otg  (x2) and  usb-on-the-go  (x9). To me they sound as referring to the very same thing (or did I miss another otg feature?).

 I'm trying to figure out the difference between  battery-life  (x122) and  battery-usage  (x16).

 We have the tags  monitoring  (x11) and  monitor  (x3). Quite obviously, the latter leads to some confusion: while some take it as a synonym to  monitoring , others take it to refer to a computer monitor.    I already re-tagged the ones referring to  monitoring  (process), which leaves those referring to a  monitor  (device).     Suggestion:  Renaming  monitor  to  external-monitor .    Hopefully this should be enough to avoid the confusion. As tag selection involves some "auto-complete" feature, people should be able to distinguish the two. Optionally, we could of course make  monitor  a synonym to... what? I'd better refrain from that, as it would re-introduce above described confusion. So, only rename the tag?

 I just stumbled upon the  file-copy  tag which, IMHO, should be merged into  file-management  and then should be made a synonym to the latter.

 Again I've stumbled upon two tags which seem to describe the exactly same issue:        recovery  (x22):          The Android recovery system is a bootable partition on an Android device...        recovery-mode  (x75):          Android's recovery mode allows ROM flashing...         The only recognizable distinction to me is the viewpoint: file system ("partition") versus boot-mode. Does that justify separate tags? I'd say: let's merge them and make the then "empty one" a synonym to the other.    Remark: We also have  data-recovery  for recovering lost files. So for consistency,  recovery-mode  should IMHO be the (main) tag (also as it already holds the majority of questions), and  recovery  the synonym. I vote for a synonym as otherwise it will for sure turn up as a new tag sooner or later, referring to either the partition or the files/data.

 After having created the  insufficient-memory  including tag excerpt and wiki, now used by 10 questions, during re-tagging I discovered the  storage-full  on the last question, which is used by 9 questions currently.    Both tags are not really equivalent ( insufficient-memory  directly refers to the "insufficient memory..." error, thus dealing  exclusively  with the devices'  internal storage  -- while  storage-full  is much broader (at least from its name, though ~80% of the questions tagged such seem to explicitly refer to "insufficient memory", and the remaining 20% at least implicitly).    My idea was to merge the two, and convert  storage-full  into a synonym  for now . So if we really feel we need a separate tag by that name at a later point, it would be easy to retain. At the moment I do not see much sense in a separate broad "storage-full" tag (my, if the card is full one needs to delete something, right? Or buy a larger card).

 We have the tags  translation  (x6) and  localization  (x65). Should the two be merged, with  translation  becoming a synonym to  localization ? The current 6 "translation questions" deal with topics very close to "localization", which would speak  for  a merge. A possible argument against could be the term "translation" being applied to content as well (as e.g. with "Google Translate").    Being unsure, I seek your opinions. Clearly, we have two options:      Yes: Merge the two and synonymize. Optionally update the tag wiki of "localization" to make it clear.   No: Translation should be applied to content.

Further, "scope" is more-or-less a standard tag on Meta sites. Examples:  Meta Stack Overflow ,  Meta Stack Exchange .    They cover the same ground.

 When I vote that a question should be closed, there are (as of April 2017) 5 options. The 2nd reads "Question is  Android-independent ) while the 4th reads " Blatantly Off-topic ".  I can still recall a previous experience where someone asked a question about  two iPhones . Soon the question got closed with the reason "Android-independent".  In the AI text it says "... for example 'Does Carrier X have prepaid plans?' ...", and from which I think what should be considered as AI should look like "I encountered this question while using Android, but it's not actually an Android problem". I can give examples that  IMO  belongs to AI, such as        Good SD Card for Android phone     Is a screen protector really neccesary (There actually is  an instance  and I'm curious why it hasn't been marked as off-topic yet)     Screen broken, how can I replace a new one        And as well, BOTs should look like        Transfer iTunes purchase   Transfer photos between phones (The one mentioned above)      But why is that question  solely about iPhones  marked as "Android-independent" instead of "Blatantly Off-topic"?

 Yes, I know there are also "internal sd cards", which might cause a little confusion here. But there's no tag for them. Instead, the tag wiki for  sd-card  (x394) clearly reads:        For questions related to the external micro-SD card used by most Android phones to increase the amount of available storage.      There you are. So what is the  external-sd  (x8) for then -- unless we want to split things up between the two explicitly, creating an "internal-sd" tag, and arguing about "How to disambiguate the  sd-card  tag? Where should that synonym point to?" :)    I'd suggest to merge  external-sd  into  sd-card . Whether we really need to make it a synonym after merging, I leave to the "executing mod" :)       As the comments raised that topic:  "What to do with questions concerning the so-called 'internal sdcard' then?"  Neither of us feels happy with that naming, but is was not us chosing it: it is not really an SDcard (in most cases, rather eMMC or the like). Despite of this,      newer devices use  /sdcard  as mount-point for this storage, placing the "real sdcard" to  /sdcard/external_sd  or the like   all forums, how-tos, manuals, whatever (you name it) are speaking of "internal SDCards", so a different term would cause confusion     terms like 'emmc-storage' would cause confusion (and might not always be "correct")   terms like 'flash-storage', 'phone-storage', 'device-storage', or 'internal-storage' could also apply to the area covered by  /system  (and sometimes are used referring to that explicitly, plus the latter is already used as  internal-storage  for exactly this)         Thus, as unhappy a term it might be, this would leave  internal-sd  as almost the only useful option, and we should use it (I volunteer creating it and re-tagging the questions from our current 'sd-card' tag appropriately, so the rename could be done  after  that step).

 The Vote to Close Review queue has been awfully active lately. While there are indeed some crap questions in there that need to be closed, there are some others that make me scratch my head.    Our rule about not allowing app recommendations is to prevent a flood of questions like        What's a good app to flurb the blag?      and nothing else.    However, I'm seeing an awful lot of questions in the review queue that      have an accepted answer   have a multiple-paragraph, detailed description of the problem the author is looking to solve   are six months old or older      That the question has a throwaway line of "what's an app that can do this?" doesn't immediately disqualify the question. Especially when the vast majority of the time the solution necessarily means an app.    I think we've lost sight of what "no app recommendations" means.    What we don't want:      Questions that are basically polls   Questions that show no research effort and are basically the OP using us as search consultants      These questions that I've been seeing in the review queue are  not  like this. They're good questions that look like they're getting close votes solely because of the fatal flaw of including a line that says "what's an app that can solve this".     I have been voting "Leave Open" on these, but as we know there can be a tendency to "dog-pile" votes, and I'm afraid that good (if slightly flawed) questions are being closed for no good reason.

 To avoid confusion, I request we rename the  transfer  (x13) to  data-transfer .     Explanation:  We already have the  file-transfer  (x96). I just went over the questions tagged  transfer , and re-tagged a few which rather referred to  file-transfer . To avoid people confusing these two tags, IMHO we should do the above mentioned tag-rename.     Optional part:  for disambiguity, we could make  transfer  a synonym to one of the two. Some facts about background for the two tags to be considered in this case: While "file-transfer" clearly refers to "files", obviously, "data-transfer" is less clear a term. Taking a look at the questions tagged such, it refers to...      PIM data such as contacts (x4, plus 1 mixed)   messages: SMS/MMS (x4)   app-data (x2)   other data: links via bluetooth, WiFi APNs (x2)      So we could also think of creating a new  contact-transfer  tag, which would make sense, and re-tag those 4+1 questions, optionally do the same for  message-transfer , and then renaming "transfer" to "data-transfer".

 I already made a similar request about half a year ago (see:  Merge firmware and rom? ). As several other tag/retag/synonym requests, this is still open and unprocessed (i.e. neither rejected nor completed). Maybe the reason is that it's still not clear which way we should go -- but for that it doesn't help to ignore it completely.    Drawing conclusions from the discussion there, let me renew my request for work-to-be-done at that place, but put it in a little different way. We should:      Rename the  firmware  tag to 'device-firmware' and (optionally) make 'firmware' a synonym (as we already have  radio-firmware , this would be consequent; here the "radio" tag was simply dropped). Also, as Flow wrote:  In the past, if we had an ambiguous tag we specialized the name(s) . This step should be performed for sure.   Optionally, again think about merging the whole thing with the  rom , as already confirmed by Flow in his comment to the answer there:  device-firmware == rom  (interpreting SaintWacko's comment following that one: "firmware != rom" as it's not clear what firmware is meant -- which is clear with our reference to "device-firmware" as opposed to "radio-firmware").   if not performing that "optional step 2", we should consider renaming 'rom' to 'stock-rom' (as opposed to  custom-rom ), for the same reasons given for #1 (specializing names). Again, 'rom' could be made a synonym or, as in the case of 'radio-firmware', simply be "dropped" (yes, there was a "radio" tag once).

 Currently,  root  is a synonym to  rooting . I want to propose separating the two:      "rooting" concerns the process of  gaining  root access to a device, as its  tag-wiki  (including the excerpt) describes.

As usual, I volunteer to sort-out (re-tag) questions accordingly.   Diversify 'root' and 'rooting' discussion  status-completed  tag-cleanup  retag-request 
 The "general 1  off-topic" explanation text already says          Questions on Android Enthusiasts should be asked from a end-user point of view and  within the scope defined in the  help center  .        And under the " What about other Android-related questions? " section, we have this for the 7 th  item             Android-independent questions, such as "Does Carrier X have prepaid plans?"            I think it's more straightforward to close as the reason of "general off-topic", and optionally leave a comment to tell OP to read  help center . Furthermore both reasons are rarely used so I think it'd be cleaner to merge them.          1. All SE sites have a similar close reason to this.      Do we really need the "Android-Independent" close reason? discussion  close-reasons 
 We have tags for individual wireless carriers. Some carriers have exclusive devices for their network, and virtually all of them customize Android to add their own software. (Euphemistically known as "bloatware".)    However, it's very rare for a question to be appropriately tagged with a carrier. Almost all of the time the asker is tagging their question to describe their device, not their question.    Further:      There may not be a tag for the asker's specific, carrier-branded device   At least one tag is required, so the asker had to add  something    etc.      You can help by looking through the questions with these carrier tags and      removing the tag if the question is not about the carrier in general; remember,  carrier-specific questions are off-topic here      this is probably also an indication that the question has other tags to describe the device and not the question      confirming that it really belongs      Here are the tags with their current question counts       verizon  &times; 41    att  &times; 17    sprint  &times; 15    t-mobile  &times; 14     orange  &times; 3    virgin-mobile  &times; 2         See also:       Manufacturer tag cleanup      Carrier tag cleanup discussion  tag-cleanup 
 If nobody comes up with a good explanation what makes the two tags different, we should merge  stock-android  (&times; 63) with  vanilla-android  (&times; 28), making the first (and more intuitive for new users) the master, and the second a synonym to it.     Note:  Questions about this originate in the comments on  Rename the 'firmware' tag to 'device-firmware' and make 'firmware' a synonym , where eldarerathis and I tried to untangle the mess with 'rom', 'stock-rom', 'device-firmware', and other tags, so one could catch some more background there.    And before somebody asks: yes, I know a stock-rom coming from e.g. Samsung is far from being vanilla. But what are people referring to when tagging a question 'stock-android'  or  'vanilla-android'? The "least common denominator". Even questions explicitly tagged vanilla using the term "stock".   Merge 'stock-android' and 'vanilla-android' discussion  synonym-request  tag-cleanup 
 According to  Wikipedia , it is one and the same device:        The  HTC Sensation  is a smartphone designed and manufactured by HTC Corporation that runs the Android 2.3 Gingerbread software stock. Officially announced by HTC on April 12, 2011, the HTC Sensation was launched by Vodafone in key European markets including the United Kingdom on May 19, 2011 and by T-Mobile in the United States on June 12, 2011 ( marketed as the HTC Sensation 4G )       (emphasis mine)        htc-sensation  &times; 15    htc-sensation-4g  &times; 12      I'd suggest making the "4g" a synonym for confused US citizens :)    Question is whether to include the  htc-sensation-xe  (&times; 8) as well, as the above quote continues:        It was the first official HTC phone to support the HTC Sense 3.0 user interface. At the time of its release, the  Sensation XE  was the world's fastest Android phone.       (emphasis again mine)     Like the  Sensation XL , the XE ("Extended Edition") is a variant of the Sensation. Differences of the XE to the base model, according to Wikipedia, seem to be a faster CPU (1.5 instead of 1.2 GHz) and a bigger battery (1730 mAh instead of 1520 mAh) only -- which for our site I see not justifying a separate tag.    For confused users again,  htc-sensation-xe  could be converted into a synonym.   Merge "htc-sensation" with "htc-sensation-4g" discussion  synonym-request  tag-cleanup 
 The  Wikipedia page for the Incredible 2  simply redirects to the "Incredible S", where it states:        The HTC Incredible S (S710E), also known as the Incredible 2, is a smartphone [...]      So quite obviously, the devices are identical. Hence my suggestion to merge  htc-droid-incredible-2  (&times; 9) with  htc-incredible-s  (&times; 12), preferably making the latter the master (as it already has a complete tag wiki) and the former, optionally, a synonym.

 I flagged some comments from a single user as spam/promotional, and the mods have suspended the account (thanks, guys!).    I looked on the  user's page , and I notice it says they are temporarily suspended until April 6  '23 .    What, exactly, is the point of a 10 year suspension? I understand the  penalty box  is appropriate, but I feel if it deserves an entire decade, shouldn't the account be deleted instead? In fact, the penalty box as described in the link for suspended accounts states that a suspension is anywhere from 1 day to 1 year.    I'm not arguing the suspension; I'm glad the mods are actively keeping the forums clean. It just seems worthless to keep an account around, hoping that in 10 years the user will have changed his ways.

 I just tapped into the  htc-mytouch  (&times; 8) tag today on my walk through our tags. Checking with Wikipedia and GSMArena, I found no such device -- just a "HTC Mytouch 4g".

 I was a Moderator here once upon a time. During my "reign" I protected  this question  due to the number of junk answers it was getting.

However, when I view that question, I can see the "unprotect" link. I have not seen that link on any other protected questions, so I can only assume that I can see it because I was the user that originally protected it.    I have not followed through to see if I can actually unprotect it, but it seems to me that displaying that link to me is unintended. (Granted, this is an edge case.

 I asked a question on  an annoyance I had with the gmail app on android on a tablet  - turned out that shortly after I asked the question, a new version fixed the issue, and as far as I'm concerned its fixed.  I'm new here, so, I'm wondering how can I make my questions and answers better.    I do wonder though whether at this point my original question is somewhat localised - and might have done better not being asked at all. I'm wondering, what's the Android Enthusiasts community standard on this - is it something that would generally be asked anyway since not all platforms may be on the latest version of the software ? Should I have added in the version of gmail client itself in my original question?   Would a question about a software annoyance fixed by an update be too localised? discussion

 Every question page has a list of related questions on the left. A few months ago, a change was rolled out on all SE sites to add a score indicator to each question in the list. On some other sites, this indicator also shows whether the question has an accepted answer.    The example below is from ux.SE. The first and third related questions do not have an accepted answer, but the second one does.         I find the answered/unanswered indication to be more useful than the question score. When looking for answers, it gives you a hint as to which related questions are likely to have the answer you're looking for. When answering questions, it gives you a hint as to which related questions might benefit from an answer you can give, or which are useful targets for "try the answers here and come back if you're still stuck" links.

 Background    I want to find out which phones have an ambient room temperature sensor, so I asked for a reference by which I could look these up.  It was immediately marked duplicate even though none of the answers to the existing question were correct for my question.    Moving on...    I asked,  https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/47143/which-phones-have-environmental-sensors-e-g-ambient-temperature-humidity-pr , and it was promptly closed as "not constructive" because...        This question is not a good fit here. It's asking for a list and it's   a list that potentially can never be complete.      But the list is apparently very small (only 1 phone) according to one commenter, and I've seen a dozen or more questions that, to me, seem similar in principle, including an entire series titled,  When will my device get the android X.Y update .  When I asked how my question is any less suitable than those, I was told,         Completely different.  Those questions are canonical references to prevent hundreds of "when will app X get Android version Y" ...      (I assume he meant, "when will  device  X get Android version Y.") By this logic and his previous reasoning, it sounds like those questions actually are not any more suitable for this site but they are allowed anyway because the mods have given up on trying to close "hundreds" of such questions.      Is this the case?  (i.e., is a special exception made for them just because so many people ask those questions?)   If so, does it follow that a canonical reference of phones' hardware specs would be allowed if there were enough people asking?   If not, then could someone please explain more clearly why a reference of android devices and supported OS versions (with release dates) is suitable while a reference of android devices and sensors is not suitable?   If this is not the place to ask my question, is there any stack exchange site where my question (or some rephrased version of it) would not be closed as  off-topic  or  not constructive ?  (Stack Overflow is not appropriate because I am not asking for coding help, and it is definitely off-topic on Super User.)   After rereading the FAQ, it sounds like  Android troubleshooting  would be a more accurate name than  Android enthusiasts  for this site. If I phrased my question in the form of a technical support question, would it then be considered appropriate for this site?  For example:  "I installed a room temperature app on a dozen different Android phones but it doesn't work on any of them (I think because they don't have ambient room temperature sensors).  What are some phones that it will work on?"   If that version is still not appropriate, why not?     Why is a canonical reference for Android versions considered appropriate but canonical reference for hardware such as sensors "not a good fit here?" discussion 
 I keep running across a ton of questions that have been closed as being not within the scope of the site, and it seems like the usefulness of this site is really being hindered by its limited scope and, to some extent, the mods themselves (no disrespect intended).  Here are some problems I've noticed just in the past day or two:      The FAQ explains that the scope is effectively just a tech support site for people having problems with their phones, which by definition means the information will become less useful and will go stale as new phones, apps, and OS versions are released.   Questions that have broadly useful information are closed so the information ends up going stale and, in some cases, becomes incorrect over time and cannot be corrected by anyone.   New questions asking for updated information that is not included in the stale answers are marked as duplicates of the old answers with little (or, in the case of a closed question, zero) hope of getting a correct answer.   In the most extreme case, I even found a community wiki answer that the mods changed to an individual answer after closing the question as "not constructive" despite being something that any true "Android Enthusiast" would actually want to know. So now nobody can edit the answer, nobody can add an updated answer, and nobody can ask the same question without getting it closed as a duplicate. Example:  Which hardware sensors are supported by Android? , 507 views in 9 months      In  More Discussion on the Scope of Android.SE , it is mentioned that the site is not for programming questions, but sometimes there are lower-level or more technical questions which are useful to programmers but not at all suitable for Stack Overflow or any other SE site.  To me, this is the type of information an enthusiast would want.  Why wouldn't one want these to be included on the "Android Enthusiasts" site?  It seems misleading for android.stackexchange.com to be so limited in its scope.    Or, to put it another way...    In any other discipline (automotive, electronics, underwater basket weaving, etc.), an  "enthusiast"  is defined as someone who mods, tinkers with, completely understands the internals and mechanics of the subject matter, and who pushes the machinery and materials to their limits and beyond--in fewer words, an  expert in the field .  But it seems like  Android Enthusiasts  is much more watered-down, to the point that its only target demographic is Jane or Joe User who is having a problem with his or her phone, and the site perhaps would be more aptly named  Android Owners  or  Android Tech Support .  Although I certainly can appreciate the need for that type of content, it seems like the current scope as outlined in the FAQ and enforced by the mods unnecessarily creates a need for yet another Android site that specifically caters to enthusiasts as the term is applied to other disciplines.  I would think you'd want as many of these people as possible to use and promote the site, but instead you're basically telling the most excited Android experts and evangelists to go back to xda-developers and other forum-based sites which are very poorly-suited for Q&amp;A-style discussions.    The Question    Most other Stack Exchange sites aim to be the singular canonical reference on their domain, crushing most other sites that previously were the better-known resources.  But it seems Android Enthusiasts considers everything  but specific technical support questions to be off-topic (except in a few cases, where questions normally considered inappropriate for the site are allowed simply because people would otherwise keep re-asking those same questions hundreds of times).  Why is the scope of Android Enthusiasts so severely limited?  Is it simply because there aren't enough mods, or is it something deeper?   Why is the scope of Android Enthusiasts so small? discussion

 This is presumably going to become more relevant, and have a bigger backlog over time as things change, but what's prompted this thought right now is  Google's recent closure and total shut-down of Google Reader .    Now that there is absolutely no way to use either the Google Reader website, the Android Google Reader app, or the Google Reader API an awful lot of the questions in  google-reader  just aren't relevant or useful any more. While some of them are really more generic RSS related questions that happen to have the Google Reader tag, many of the others are very specific question about the app or service. While I don't think that these necessarily need deleting (there are answers on there that were previously good and useful, and they don't deserve to lose the associated rep just because things have changed), there's also no reason to leave the question open when it's never going to receive another good answer.    Previously these would have been a good candidate to "Vote-To-Close" as " Too Localized "  (in time)  but  there is no "Too Localized" reason any more . What should we do with these types of questions?    Edit: should probably also point out that Google Reader is just a topical example. In the future this could also apply to many other commonly used services that rely on a backend provided by a single company, eg Facebook, GMail, Twitter, Skydrive, Flickr, Dropbox and so on.

 When I was reviewing a  question  today, I tried to make some changes to the title and content of the question. This is something I have done before with no problem, but this time I ran into an error message:        This edit would have to be a suggested edit.      As I have less than 2000 reputation points, I have always done suggested edits; I lack permissions to do anything but.    What is this error message? It is useless to me,     Could it be related to the fact that I am so close to 2000 points? Has the suggested edit functionality been changed with the recent overhaul of closing/holding questions? Is there supposed to be a checkbox saying this is a suggested edit? I'm just throwing out possible avenues; I really have no idea what the problem is.    A  google search  for the exact error message string come back with 0 results, though I suspect in a few minutes there will be a single result for this question. This leads some credence to the error being a new backend change (and probably a bug at that), since no one else has run into it yet.     Edit : Now when I go to that specific question, the  edit  button is disabled. It isn't disabled for other questions, though.

 Problem at hand:    The question " How do you link to applications in the Android market? " is being marked as duplicate of the closed question " How to post a link to an android market app? [duplicate] ", that in turn mentions the first one as duplicate, causing an infinite cycle.    This appears to happen more often that it should and I am not sure of what's the appropriated action to take with this scenario.    What should be done?    Should this questions be flagged as to report the issue  or  should one just skip this subject on the review for close votes (assuming that there's already a method to deal with this...) ?

 I was contacted privately by an OP of this  question  (now deleted).        Hi I am the same guy with as here. I found your email by googling your DN . Sorry for contacting you via email but it is really getting very difficult for me to debug the problem. Would you mind if I ask you to come over skype or something like that?         I am kind of getting desperate since its only a 6 month old phone without any warranty.         Regards      In my book, it is highly unfair seeking one on one support to resolve the issue, however, time and personal life, working etc... it is deemed unfair to put me in the spot and also unfair on the community, notice how the email sounds desperate and not being patient enough to wait for turn-around time for someone else on this site to answer, nor being patient either does not help.    Sending one on one private email should not be allowed on a community site unless contacted by way of message, or even chat, but on email... no...     What is the best course of action?    Edit    Just noticed that the OP now has supplied the answer to their own question...  sigh      This  from, another forum (directly quoted from Modaco), sums it up succinctly.        It is extremely rude and unfair to contact a person directly and   expecting personal 1-on-1 support. They have personal lives away from   the forum and this should be respected.        If you have any questions then ask them in the relevant forum thread.   If you do not receive an answer straight away then wait. Sometimes it   may take more than 24 hours for somebody to reply to you. If you do   not find the answer you are looking for or do not get a reply then try   re-wording your question giving as much information as possible. Logs   are useful, screenshots are useful.        These forums are a community and by asking questions openly you are   helping other members. Asking questions privately is rude and   inconsiderate to ASE users, and not fair on the rest of the community.     Getting contacted privately discussion  etiquette

 I was going to update the wiki question  How do I root my Android device?  to include the Samsung Galaxy S4, but I wanted to make sure the update I was going to add was following the proper formatting, linking, etc. for the answer.     I was going to add the Galaxy S4 and link to this xda post:      http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2290798     However it seems to be limited to Verizon and doesn't work on the most recent Build release.

Should I not include the VRUAME7 Build link since it is not really a root method? Should I not include the VRUAMDK Build since it won't work for most people (if they didn't update it will work at least)?

 I was answering the question  Do I root to my model, or my version number?  where the user need to root a particular device and I assumed that it miss-phrased the title.

 I struggled for a while reading  this question  where the OP was asking for a consistent answer about the Android battery, battery calibration and battery usage.    He pointed out several answers from different users that present a conflict on advices on how should an Android user proceed with battery maintenance and usage.    The question raised on my head after reading this was:     Are we giving the appropriated information about battery usage and maintenance?      that in turn lead me here to discuss this matter, because if we've got contradictory information, some one is wrong or the specifics of each situation require a more careful explanation about the battery maintenance and usage.       Should we have a canonical question e.g.:    How do I take care of the battery of my device?

 In reference to  Where can I find stock or custom ROMs for my Android device?     Lately the answer has gotten a few fairly localized additions that I have edited out.

Are up-to-date   Are pretty popular and recognized as useful resources by the Android community   Are somewhat well done and organized      And we should keep out sites that are too localized, half-baked, or generally not useful to a large portion of our users.

 A User just marked three different questions and three different answers as duplicates and I challenge anyone to review them.       Heimdall errors, “ERROR: Failed to detect compatible download-mode device.”     Heimdall errors, “ERROR: Partition ”recovery“ does not exist in the specified PIT.”     Heimdall errors, “ERROR: Failed to confirm end of file transfer sequence!”       According to @t0mmb13b, 1 is a dupe of 2. 2 is a dupe of 3. And, 3 is a dupe of 1 and 2. This is nothing short of a total failure to read any of them. I took time to enter these errors into android.stackexchange.com. I didn't do it for me, I did it for others that may run into these problems with Heimdall.  They're all self-answered . And, all of these shared a similar format in the title for easy disambiguation by visitors and search engines. All of these errors are caused by different symptoms so I'll summarize them here.     The numbers correspond to the above       This is caused by the device not being in  download mode . The device must be put in a different mode.   This is caused by the command's partition argument being lowercase. This is really awkward for a Linux/GNU guy, because  heimdall (5)  breaks convention, that  --argument  is the same as  --ARGUMENT , what should have happened is that  heimdall  should have done  --partition_name "ARGUMENT"  instead. For those who make these most basic-assumptions about Linux utilities, Heimdall is likely to cause confusion. The error message heimdall produces is also useless for most people.   This is caused by a bug in a release candidate of  heimdall . It simply needs to be updated. Why is this important if it's just a release candidate then? Simple,  heimdall  is frozen at 1.4rc1 in the  Ubuntu repository .      Users need to read the questions and answers before they comment. This kind of closing of questions and answers just discourages involvement. The onus can't be on the submitter to explain why his stuff is different when the judge, jury, and executioner was simply too lazy to read.

  Froyo  and  Gingerbread  each added a lot of changes compared to their predecessors.  Honeycomb  caused a lot of confusion, what with it only ever being available for a very few tablets.  Ice Cream Sandwich  was a big deal, with a  lot  of changes. Each of the  Jelly   Bean   iterations , less so (although "Project Butter" was a significant improvement).    The idea with the first of these Community Wiki questions was to act as a repository of knowledge and to short-circuit the plethora of "When will {name of device} get Android {version}?" questions that we saw.     Are these still needed?     By all indications, the Nexus 5 and Android 4.4 (KitKat&reg;) are going to be released in about four weeks. The last few Nexus devices will get it (those not encumbered by carrier customizations, that is, like my Verizon Galaxy Nexus) and the flagship devices of the big OEMs within a few months.    But will we really be saving ourselves from a bunch of "When will {name of device} get Android 4.4?" questions if we make another Community Wiki?    Google has done a lot to move key functionality out of the OS into updateable apps/services. (By golly, remember when we had to get an Android update to get a new Gmail?) There's not much of anything in Android 4.3 that I feel like I'm missing on my VZW GNex at 4.2.2. Things are much different now than when a new version of the OS made the device feel brand new.    Also, it takes time and effort to keep those lists updated. Even though they're Community Wiki, I've only ever seen a handful of people add information to the answers. Plus, they get out-dated. No one is clamoring for information on Froyo or Gingerbread, and few are still looking for information on Ice Cream Sandwich. Anyone still on prior versions there have resigned themselves to the version they have or have taking the plunge with a custom ROM.    So, should we continue to create and maintain these Community Wiki Android version questions/answers?    More importantly, if we don't,  how should we handle the inevitable  "When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"  questions?

 We get a lot of spam answers (and I've just seen a spam edit) with links to domains selling dubious software. There are a few websites that claim to offer tutorials for recovering data from a broken phone, but the "tutorial" is an advert for PC software.    The links are added indiscriminately by newly registered or anonymous users, often to inappropriate questions, and also sometimes to questions where they would be a reasonable answer. The text themselves is often spammy-looking, repeating the same phrasing several times or pasting text from their site, for SEO purposes. Even when the answers are sometimes relevant, I don't think we ought to encourage commercial users to follow this scatter-shot approach and rely on our users spending time deciding which posts might be appropriate.    The websites in question look suspicious because (1) they don't give any contact details or official information on the company selling the software, not even a country of origin; (2) they offer a PC software download for an Android problem; (3) they have heavy use of SEO keywords, often with a separate URL per device; (4) often they hide their WHOIS information to make sure you can't find out who they are. These are not properties of honest software businesses.    Domains I've seen people try to link to include:      istonsoft.com (hidden whois information)   swesoft.com (based in CN)   android-data-recovery-software.com (same owner as swesoft)   z0download.com (hidden whois information;  here's a huge edit that added this link )   yodot.com (hidden whois information;  here's an answer )   android-mobile-manager.com (hidden whois information)      We have a zillion questions on recovering deleted files, and AFAICT they all attract this kind of spammy answer/edit. Certainly, several have been protected for this reason.

 It's the time of the year again, namely it is December 2013, and so we shall now refresh our Community Promotion Ads for the new year.    What are Community Promotion Ads?    Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.    Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?    This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:      interesting Android apps   the site's twitter account   cool events or conferences   anything else your community would genuinely be interested in      The goal is for future visitors to find out about  the stuff your community deems important . This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are  relevant to your own community's interests , both for those already in the community and those yet to join.     Why do we reset the ads every year?    Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.    The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.    How does it work?    The answers you post to this question  must  conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored.        All answers should be in the exact form of:     [![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]     [1]: http://image-url    [2]: http://clickthrough-url       Please  do not add anything else to the body of the post . If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.     The question must always be tagged with the magic  community-ads  tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.       Image requirements      The image that you create must be  220 x 250 pixels    Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)   Must be GIF or PNG   No animated GIFs   Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB      Score Threshold    There is a  minimum score threshold  an answer must meet (currently  6 ) before it will be shown on the main site.    You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats  here .   Community Promotion Ads - 2014 discussion  community-ads 
 Here's a project for us non-Moderators:    The tag  multiple-accounts  appears to be covering much of the same ground as  multi-user .    The tag wiki of the latter currently states:        Multi-user is a term that defines an operating system, computer program, or a game that allows use by more than one users of the same computer at the same time. Android 4.2 Jelly Bean brought multi-user support to Android tablets.      So, it looks like  multiple-accounts  is a candidate to be a synonym for  multi-user , but it's not currently "clean" enough to force a re-tag.    Here's the project: Go through each of the (currently) 21 questions tagged  multiple-accounts  and retag them appropriately. At the very least, anything that is tagged  multiple-accounts   and   multi-user  the former is redundant and should be removed. Also, if there are other issues with the question, fix those too.    Once cleaned up to the degree possible we can either let the tag die, set it as a synonym, or, if there are still some questions using it, define an appropriate wiki definition.   Tag cleanup needed: [multiple-accounts] and [multi-user] discussion  status-completed  tag-cleanup 
 Preamble    I have read the   META   and the   WIKI   product of it and then followed by the self answered   META   so just wanted to make clear I am not asking this question lightly or without extensive reading and research of existing discussion. I just feel that some valuable (however subtle) perspective is missing in the decision to generalize discussion on this subject due possibly to the lack of actual development experience or participation in the evolution of the HIY. Either of these would make it clear that while many might be lazy players who are shopping for "cool" things to check out and play with, there are those who legitimately want to learn about their device, explore its capabilities and expand on them if possible. We should be focused on the latter and not deprive more in depth discussion for fear of the "shoppers" as they have been called. The benefit far outweighs any sinister abuse which can be easily moderated out.    Argument    I believe that there is a very legitimate case to be made for allowing more than cursory discussion on custom ROMs this community is dedicated to Android and part of that is the open source and customization nature of it. This means that people try to expand functionality, remove limitations and all in all try to develop a better experience. While as professionals we might argue that general sources are sufficient to decide for one's self what to do and how to go about exploring the options, what happens to the more novice members who look to a community such as this for insight, expertise, shared experience knowledge and assistance.    Why not allow a user to say, I am using Device X from Provider Y and I would like to find a ROM that allows me to remove the bloatware that was installed on there and expand functionality, GUI, tweaks, and so on; what would work best with my setup? People who can apply their general knowledge to help narrow the sea of ROMs and suggest a few can help. Those who own the same device and have experimented with various ROMs can share their experiences first hand and make suggestions and give notes and warnings. Those who own the device but were too green or unaware of a way to expand functionality can benefit by learning from the discussion. It can serve as a truly great way to engage the masses and while some devices might be extremely localized and limited in scope, others will be useful to a much greater range of people. Either way, it will make this community a beacon of knowledge that has been amassed and shared. Who does it hurt to discuss specifics? For every 1 person who is active in the discussion there are 100's if not more who are benefiting from reading and referencing the discussion. Long after it has been resolved for the OP, the discussion will remain for any future seeker who find it and resolves their problem, living up to the goal of such a community.     Isn't that what we want? I don't understand sometimes the elitist approach taken to what question is allowed and what is not. If it relates to Android, however broad or narrow, its relevant and should be allowed, as long as it is not abusive, offensive, illegal, or promotion. Thoughts?   Why can't I ask "What's the best ROM for me?" discussion  status-bydesign  questions

  This question  has a bunch of development-related keywords like "build" "development" and "package".    However it is not really a question about "developing  for  Android", it's about "developing  on  Android". Using Android as a development platfrom is, in the concept of Android,  using , not developing.    It's asking about missing shared library symbols, and after searching on Google, I found the answer is "Build ZeroMQ from scratch by yourself". This answer is, however, off-topic on Android. But it does not affect the question.    In short, the question is similar to        I wrote a program on Android using Termux, and the dynamic linker said it's missing a symbol "pw->pw_gecos".      So what? I can well remember Dan Hulme ♦ said (from my memory, exact wording may vary)        If your question is about using Android as a development platform, it's OK. But if you ask something like "I wrote this code on my Android phone, what's wrong with it", it's clearly off-topic      I can't find the quotation above but I'm fairly sure it's said by Dan Hulme somewhere on this site (A.M.SE).

 It seems to me that the quality of this SE site is low. Most questions appear to be about minor issues/bugs rather than Android itself. Should something be done about the quality or allowed topic?    Examples:    This seems like a bug rather than a "real" Android issue -  Google Nexus 7 not recognized via USB     Use Google -  Is there a valid Android alternative to iTunes U?     Too Localized? -  How to connect your Nexus phone to a VGA projector?        Did this break the rules? -  What&#39;s the risk of installing Cyanogen Mod on unsupported phone?     Some questions are accepted even though they are questions open to debate.  See  ( https://android.stackexchange.com/tour ) - " Questions with too many possible answers, or that would require an extremely long answer ". The user in the above link asks for possible risks, which is not easily answered question, thus breaking the quoted rule. Yet, this user's question received many upvotes.       I think it would also help this site if the criteria for good Android questions were more "clear cut".    EDIT NOTE: I removed everything about Cyanogenmod since that seemed to confuse the people reading it. Yes, I understand the definition of Cyanogenmod and Raspbian.

 This is inspired from this answer to my question -  Can there be malicious apps on Google Play?         Aside of that: In case you're still unsure, pick a good forum and ask. Another good idea is to check other apps from the same developer (just follow the link on his name), and use above criteria on them.      Since currently finding an ad-free application is not easy, is it OK to ask for recommendations (i.e. for example "Can someone recommend an ad-free FTP server that is not a virus")?.    I looked in the FAQ and it said app-recommendations are considered "primarily opinion-based", and if I ask "What is the best app doing X", it would be true, but ad-free and not-virus is just true or false, there is no opinion there.   Is it OK to ask about ad-free apps that are not a virus? discussion  app-recommendation

 I've seen in an unanswered question that an user posted what seems to be an answer as a  comment . That user has not posted it as an answer although someone suggested him to do so (maybe he has not logged in since then so he is not aware of this). It has passed more than a year after that comment, and no one has answered the question. There are probably people who are going through the same situation described in this question, but seeing that there is still no answer they desist to clicking on it, likely ignoring the comment with which the user gave the right answer to his own question.     A simple solution would be to copy and paste the comment as my own answer, winning reputation at the expense of someone else's effort, but exactly that makes it an  unethical  action.    My question is: is there any way that one of the moderators would  promote  that comment to the category of  answer , without user intervention needed, so that the user who made the comment gets all the credit (reputation) for having answered correctly the question, as it should be?

 Of late I have observed that a few questions have been raised, which on close inspection  look off-topic  however were carrying an active bounty.    In one case, I tried to  salvage the post  with significant edits to make sure that OP could perhaps get an answer that solves their issue at least also to avoid unnecessary wastage of bounty rep (hard earned rep) from the OP's point of view.     Recently there came another  post with active bounty  which I reckon can be deemed  off-topic  (asking for app recommendations), but in this case I am not too sure how this can be handled. I also think the OP was looking for a different way to solve the problem and not strictly app recommendation, however the investor seems to be looking for an application.    In this case how can off-topic (or low quality posts) be handled when they carry an active bounty, AFAICT, under normal circumstances, such posts are put on hold to allow OP to revise the posts (and then re-open or closed)?    Other cases including:      Posts which are unclear   Duplicates (I hardly recall a question which had active bounty but was a duplicate, and one user commented on the duplicity of the post, and initially OP didn't know this but later regretted having used their bounty on an duplicate post)     How to handle off-topic questions with active bounty? discussion
